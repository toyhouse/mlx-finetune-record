For example:\n\n* The Antarctic Ice Sheet will expand more quickly because its area is being squared (2n^2), which increases faster than the Arctic Ice Sheet's area, which is being multiplied by a constant factor (n^2).\n* The Antarctic Ice Sheet's formula has an additional term (8n) that increases linearly with n, whereas the Arctic Ice Sheet's formula only has a quadratic term (n^2).

Similarly, the term n in the denominator becomes smaller compared to the constant term 2 in the numerator.\n\nTherefore, for large values of n, the ratio (2n + 8) / (n^2 + 4n) approaches 2, which means that the Antarctic Ice Sheet expands more quickly than the Arctic Ice Sheet.\n\n**Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests mathematical reasoning skills in the following areas:\n\n* Algebraic manipulation and simplification\n* Comparison of rates of change using derivatives\n* Analysis of behavior of functions as variables increase\n* Logical reasoning to determine which type of ice sheet expands more quickly.\n\n"}

The total number of conifers remains the same, so we can set up the equation:\n\n8C = (2n)C\n\nSince C represents the number of conifers for each row of apple trees, it's reasonable to assume that C is not equal to zero. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by C:\n\n8 = 2n\n\nNow, we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n4 = n\n\nHowever, this solution doesn't match any of the scoring criteria because it doesn't explicitly show algebraic methods.\n\nLet's try another approach. Since Maria notices that if she doubles the number of rows of apple trees, the total number of conifers will be the same as the original number of apple trees, we can set up an equation based on this information:\n\nn^2 = 8n\n\nNow, we can solve for n by rearranging the equation and factoring out n:\n\nn^2 - 8n = 0\n\nn(n-8) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for n: n=0 or n=8. Since n represents the number of rows of apple trees, it's reasonable to assume that n is not equal to zero. Therefore, we can conclude that n=8.\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests mathematical reasoning and algebraic skills, specifically:\n\n*   Algebraic methods for solving equations\n*   Pattern recognition and extension\n*   Critical thinking and problem-solving strategies\n\nBy using algebraic methods and pattern recognition, students demonstrate their ability to solve problems that require mathematical reasoning and critical thinking.\n\n"}

Which of the following statements best interprets this forecast?\n\nA) 30% of the land in the forecast area will get rain.\nB) 30% of the 6 hours (a total of 108 minutes) will have rain.\nC) For the people in that area, 30 out of every 100 people will experience rain.\nD) If the same prediction was given for 100 days, then about 30 days out of the 100 days will have rain.\nE) The amount of rain will be 30% of a heavy rainfall (as measured by rainfall per unit time).\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n1. Correct Answer (D): 3 points\n2. Incorrect but plausible answer (A, B, or C): 1 point\n3. No clear interpretation of the forecast (E): 0 points\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Understand the context: The weather forecast predicts that 30% of days will experience rainfall between 12 noon and 6 pm.\n2. Identify the key concept: The question is asking for an interpretation of the forecast, which means we need to understand what the percentage value represents in this context.\n3. Analyze option D: \"If the same prediction was given for 100 days, then about 30 days out of the 100 days will have rain.\"\n4. Recognize that option D is a correct interpretation of the forecast. The 30% probability means that, on average, 30 out of every 100 days will experience rainfall.\n5. Eliminate incorrect options:\n\t* A) 30% of the land in the forecast area will get rain: This option misinterprets the percentage value as a proportion of the land area, rather than a proportion of days with rainfall.\n\t* B) 30% of the 6 hours (a total of 108 minutes) will have rain: This option misunderstands the meaning of the percentage value in this context. The forecast is about daily probability, not hourly or minute-by-minute probability.\n\t* C) For the people in that area, 30 out of every 100 people will experience rain: This option misinterprets the percentage value as a proportion of individuals, rather than a proportion of days with rainfall.\n\t* E) The amount of rain will be 30% of a heavy rainfall (as measured by rainfall per unit time): This option misunderstands the meaning of the percentage value in this context. The forecast is about daily probability, not the magnitude of rainfall.\n\n**Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests mathematical reasoning and understanding of probability concepts, specifically:\n\n* Interpreting probability values in different contexts\n* Understanding the relationship between probability and proportion\n* Recognizing correct and incorrect interpretations of statistical information\n\nThe problem requires students to think critically about the meaning of the percentage value in this context and to distinguish between correct and incorrect interpretations.\n\n"}

{"text": "You are a tutor for PISA mathematics questions. You provide questions and evaluate student responses.\n\nHuman: Please provide a math question about CONTINENT AREA\nAssistant: **Problem Statement:**\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is expanding at an alarming rate due to climate change. The ice sheet's surface area has increased by approximately 13,000 square kilometers over the past decade. If the expansion continues at this rate, how many more square kilometers will the ice sheet cover in the next 10 years?\n\n**Mathematical Representation:**\n\nLet x be the number of additional square kilometers covered by the ice sheet each year.\n\nThe initial surface area of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is approximately 14 million square kilometers. The expansion can be represented by the equation:\n\nA(t) = 14,000,000 + 13,000x\n\nwhere A(t) is the total surface area at time t (in years).\n\n**Question:**\n\nAssuming the rate of expansion remains constant, which variable will increase more quickly: x or A(t)?\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\nScore 2(1):\n\n* The answer is correct and provides a clear algebraic explanation based on the formula A(t) = 14,000,000 + 13,000x.\n* The explanation demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between x and A(t), including how the linear term (13,000x) affects the overall growth rate.\n\nExample:\n\n\"The number of additional square kilometers covered by the ice sheet each year will increase more quickly because it is represented by the linear term 13,000x in the equation A(t). This means that as x increases, A(t) will increase at a faster rate due to the multiplication factor. In contrast, the constant term 14,000,000 represents the initial surface area, which does not change with time.\"\n\nScore 1(1):\n\n* The answer is correct and provides specific examples or uses data from the table to demonstrate the relationship between x and A(t).\n* The explanation shows some understanding of the relationship between x and A(t), but may not be as clear or concise as in Score 2(1).\n\nExample:\n\n\"From the table, we can see that the number of additional square kilometers covered by the ice sheet each year increases faster than the total surface area.

They should recognize that x represents the number of additional square kilometers covered by the ice sheet each year, while A(t) represents the total surface area at time t.\n\nStudents can then use algebraic manipulations to compare the growth rates of x and A(t). One approach is to rewrite the equation as:\n\nA(t) = 14,000,000 + (13,000x)\n\nThis allows students to see that A(t) is equal to a constant term (14,000,000) plus a linear term (13,000x).\n\nTo compare the growth rates of x and A(t), students can use the concept of exponential growth. Since A(t) is a quadratic function, its graph will be a parabola that opens upward. In contrast, x is a linear function, whose graph will be a straight line.\n\nBy analyzing the graphs of x and A(t), students can see that as x increases, A(t) will increase at a faster rate due to the multiplication factor 13,000. This demonstrates that x will increase more quickly than A(t).\n\n**Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests mathematical reasoning skills, including:\n\n* Algebraic manipulation and simplification\n* Understanding of linear and quadratic functions\n* Comparison of growth rates using graphs and algebraic manipulations\n* Critical thinking and logical reasoning\n\n"}
