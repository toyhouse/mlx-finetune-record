A straight path cuts diagonally across the garden.  Calculate the length of this diagonal path, in meters. Show your reasoning.\n\n**Diagram Prompt:**\n\nCreate a diagram representing a rectangular garden.  The garden should be clearly labeled with a length of 12 meters and a width of 5 meters.  A straight, dashed line should represent a path cutting diagonally across the garden, connecting opposite corners.  Label the length of this diagonal path as 'd' (or a similar variable).  The diagram should clearly show the right triangle formed by the length, width, and diagonal path.  Do *not* include the calculated length of the diagonal path on the diagram.  The diagram should be clean, easy to understand, and accurately represent the given dimensions and the diagonal path.  Avoid any unnecessary embellishments or details.  The focus should be on the geometric relationships.\n\n**Example Diagram Description (for image generation tools):**\n\nA rectangle representing the garden, oriented horizontally. The longer side (horizontal) is labeled 12m, and the shorter side (vertical) is labeled 5m. A dashed line runs diagonally from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. This diagonal line is labeled 'd'. The right angle formed by the length and width of the garden should be clearly indicated. The background should be plain and uncluttered.\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\nScore 1(1): Answers which correctly apply the Pythagorean theorem and show all work leading to the correct answer (13 meters).\n\nScore 1(2): Answers which state the correct length (13 meters) but without showing clear calculations or with minor explanation errors.\n\nScore 1(3): Answers which show an attempt to apply the Pythagorean theorem but contain calculation errors or demonstrate a misunderstanding of how to apply the theorem (e.g., adding the sides instead of squaring them).\n\nScore 0(0): Other answers, including incorrect applications of the Pythagorean theorem or no answer.\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nThe diagonal path forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the length and width of the garden are the two shorter sides (legs).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):  a² + b² = c².\n\nIn this case, a = 12 meters and b = 5 meters. We need to find c.\n\n12² + 5² = c²\n144 + 25 = c²\n169 = c²\nc = √169\nc = 13 meters\n\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal path is 13 meters.\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem assesses:\n\n- Understanding and application of the Pythagorean theorem.\n- Identifying the hypotenuse and legs in a right triangle within a real-world context.\n- Performing accurate calculations involving squares and square roots.\n- Logical reasoning and problem-solving in a geometric context."}]}
