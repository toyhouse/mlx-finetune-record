{"text": "You are a tutor for PISA mathematics questions. You provide questions and evaluate student responses.\n\nHuman: Please provide a math question about LICHEN M047Q02- 0 1 2 8 9\nAssistant: **Problem Statement:**\n\nThe diameter of a lichen sample was measured to be 8 cm in the spring of 2005. The rate of growth of the lichen is given by the formula:\n\nDiameter (cm) = Initial Diameter (cm) + (Rate of Growth \u00d7 Time)\n\nwhere Rate of Growth is in cm/year and Time is in years.\n\nUsing this formula, calculate the diameter of the lichen 16 years after the ice disappeared. Show your calculation.\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n* Code 2: Full credit\n\t+ Correct application of the formula with correct units.\n* Code 1: Partial credit\n\t+ Correct substitution of values into the formula but incorrect answer.\n\t+ Incomplete answer that shows correct substitution but lacks final calculation or unit consideration.\n* Code 0: No credit\n\t+ Other responses that do not demonstrate correct mathematical reasoning.\n* Code 9: Missing\n\t+ No attempt to solve the problem.\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Understand the formula and the given information\n\nThe formula is D = I + (R \u00d7 T), where:\n- D is the diameter of the lichen at time T,\n- I is the initial diameter (8 cm),\n- R is the rate of growth, and\n- T is the time in years.\n\nWe are given that the ice disappeared 16 years ago, so we want to find the diameter after 16 years. However, since the problem states \"the ice disappeared,\" it implies that the lichen started growing from a certain point. Assuming this means the initial diameter was 0 cm (or negligible), we can simplify our calculation.\n\nStep 2: Substitute values into the formula\n\nGiven I = 8 cm and T = 16 years, we want to find D when R is unknown but can be calculated using another given value.\n\nHowever, there's a missing piece of information in the problem statement. To proceed with a mathematically rigorous solution, let's assume that the rate of growth (R) is provided or can be derived from another part of the question not shown here. For the sake of this example, we'll assume R = 0.7 cm/year.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the diameter\n\nUsing the formula D = I + (R \u00d7 T), substitute the known values:\n\nD = 8 cm + (0.7 cm/year \u00d7 16 years)\n\nD = 8 cm + 11.2 cm\n\nD \u2248 19.2 cm\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests students' ability to apply a given formula with correct units and mathematical reasoning, including:\n\n1. Understanding the formula and its components.\n2. Substituting values into the formula correctly.\n3. Performing calculations accurately.\n4. Applying mathematical concepts such as rate of growth and time.\n\n**Note:** The original problem statement lacks crucial information about the rate of growth (R) necessary for a complete solution. This example provides a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how a PISA-style mathematics problem could be structured, focusing on applying a formula with correct units and reasoning.\n\n"}
