# JSONL File Structure Analysis - test_valid.jsonl

This file contains 4 entries in JSONL format. Each entry is a single line containing a JSON object with one field: `text`. The `text` field contains a conversation with three parts: system instruction, human input, and assistant response.

## Entry 1: Teaching Numbers 11-19
```json
{
    "text": "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method.\n\nHuman: How are the numbers from 11 to 19 introduced?\nAssistant: We write the numbers 11-19 on a big piece of cardboard and ask the students to read them. This helps them recognize and name those numbers, before moving on to adding numbers that result in sums between 11 and 19.\n\n"
}
```
Fields breakdown:
- System role: "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method."
- Human query: "How are the numbers from 11 to 19 introduced?"
- Assistant response: Explains the visual approach using cardboard

## Entry 2: PISA Question - Payments by Area
```json
{
    "text": "You are a tutor for PISA mathematics questions. You provide questions and evaluate student responses.\n\nHuman: Please provide a math question about PAYMENTS BY AREA M480Q01\nAssistant: [Detailed PISA question about apartment areas and student heights with extensive scoring guidelines and solution]"
}
```
Fields breakdown:
- System role: "You are a tutor for PISA mathematics questions..."
- Human query: "Please provide a math question about PAYMENTS BY AREA M480Q01"
- Assistant response: Complex problem with multiple parts about apartment areas

## Entry 3: Teaching Multiplication
```json
{
    "text": "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method.\n\nHuman: How do you explain the concept of multiplication using a number line?\nAssistant: We explain multiplication on a number line as repeated jumps of equal length. For example, to show 3 x 4, we start at zero, and make **three jumps of four units each**. The number where we land shows the answer. So, 3 jumps of 4 gives us 12, illustrating that 3 x 4 = 12.\n\n"
}
```
Fields breakdown:
- System role: "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method."
- Human query: "How do you explain the concept of multiplication using a number line?"
- Assistant response: Visual explanation using number line jumps

## Entry 4: Teaching Subtraction with Exchange
```json
{
    "text": "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method.\n\nHuman: Can you give an example of subtracting a 1-digit number from a 2-digit number using 'exchanging'?\nAssistant: Certainly. Let's take 32 - 5. First, we show 32 using **3 black cards** (tens) and **2 white cards** (ones). We can't take away 5 from the 2 ones so, we exchange **1 black card** for **10 white cards**. Now we have **2 black cards** and **12 white cards**. Now we can take away 5 white cards from 12, leaving **7 white cards** and **2 black cards** remaining. Thus, we have 27.\n\n"
}
```
Fields breakdown:
- System role: "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method."
- Human query: "Can you give an example of subtracting a 1-digit number from a 2-digit number using 'exchanging'?"
- Assistant response: Step-by-step explanation using colored cards

## Common Patterns
1. Every entry has exactly one field: `text`
2. The `text` field always contains three components separated by "\n\n":
   - System role definition
   - Human query prefixed with "Human: "
   - Assistant response prefixed with "Assistant: "
3. Two distinct system roles appear:
   - Gasing method math teacher (Entries 1, 3, and 4)
   - PISA mathematics tutor (Entry 2)
4. Markdown formatting (** **) is used in some responses for emphasis
5. Each entry ends with "\n\n"
