The compass points indicate the orientation of each storey.\n\n[Insert diagram]\n\nA) The number of storeys in the building is 20.\nB) Each storey has an area that is 25% larger than the previous one.\nC) The total area of all storeys combined is 2500 square meters.\n\nWhat can be concluded from the information provided?\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n* A) Correct identification of the number of storeys (1 point)\n* B) Correct calculation or explanation of the relationship between the areas of consecutive storeys (2 points)\n* C) Correct total area calculation (3 points)\n\nTotal score: 6 points\n\n**Example Solution and Key Reasoning Steps:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use mathematical reasoning to understand the relationships between the areas of consecutive storeys.\n\n1. Since each storey has an area that is 25% larger than the previous one, we can represent the relationship as follows:\n\nArea of Storey 2 = Area of Storey 1 + (0.25 \u00d7 Area of Storey 1)\n\nThis means that the area of Storey 2 is 125% of the area of Storey 1.\n\n2. To find the total area, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nTotal Area = n/2 \u00d7 (a1 + an)\n\nwhere:\nn = number of storeys\na1 = area of first storey\nan = area of last storey\n\nIn this case, we know that each storey has an area 25% larger than the previous one. Let's assume the area of Storey 1 is x.\n\nThen, the area of Storey 2 is x + (0.25x) = 1.25x\nThe area of Storey 3 is (1.25x) + (0.25(1.25x)) = 1.5625x\n...\nThe area of Storey 20 is (1.25^19)x\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total area:\n\nTotal Area = 20/2 \u00d7 (x + (1.25^19)x)\n= 10 \u00d7 (1.25^20)x\n= 2500 square meters\n\nTherefore, C) The total area of all storeys combined is indeed 2500 square meters.\n\n**Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests the following mathematical skills:\n\n* Understanding of geometric relationships and proportions\n* Ability to apply formulas for arithmetic series\n* Critical thinking and logical reasoning\n* Communication of mathematical ideas through clear explanations\n\nNote: The problem is designed to be solvable with basic algebraic manipulations, making it accessible to students in upper secondary education.\n\n"}

Missing (Code 9): The student does not provide an answer.\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of exponents and logarithms. We are given the equation 2^x = 5000. To find the value of x, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog2(2^x) = log2(5000)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that states loga(a^b) = b, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\nx = log2(5000)\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we can use a calculator or estimate the value. Since 2^13 \u2248 8192 and 2^14 \u2248 16384, we know that x must be between 13 and 14.\n\nLet's try to find an approximate value for x:\n\nx \u2248 log2(5000) \u2248 12.64\n\nSince x is approximately equal to 12.64, the closest integer value would be 13.\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests the student's ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios and make logical connections between different pieces of information.

The mission aimed to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) with food and supplies for a crew of six astronauts. On its way back to Earth, the shuttle encountered an unexpected solar flare that damaged its communication equipment.\n\nTo assess the impact of the solar flare on the shuttle's navigation system, engineers used data from the shuttle's onboard computer to calculate the time it took for the flare to affect the navigation system. The data showed that the navigation system was affected after 45 minutes and 27 seconds (45:27) had passed since launch.\n\nUsing this information, create a formula to calculate the time (in hours and minutes) when the solar flare would have no effect on the navigation system. Express your answer in the form \"HH:MM\".\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n* Full credit (1 point): The solution is correct and follows the format HH:MM.\n* 0.5 points (2/4): The solution is mostly correct, but the time unit is incorrect or the format is not followed exactly.\n* 0 points (3/4): The solution is partially correct, but it lacks one or more key components.\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Convert the given time from minutes and seconds to just hours and minutes.\n45 minutes = 0.75 hours\n27 seconds = 0.45 minutes\n\nTotal time in hours and minutes = 0.75 + 0.45 = 1.20 hours\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time when the solar flare would have no effect on the navigation system by subtracting the affected time from the total flight time.\nTotal flight time = 10 hours (assuming a typical shuttle mission duration)\nTime without effect = Total flight time - Affected time\n= 10 hours - 1.20 hours\n= 8.80 hours\n\nStep 3: Convert the result back to hours and minutes.\n8.80 hours \u2248 8 hours and 48 minutes\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe formula to calculate the time when the solar flare would have no effect on the navigation system is:\n\nTime without effect = Total flight time - Affected time\n= 10 hours - (45 minutes + 27 seconds)\n= 10 hours - 1.20 hours\n= 8.80 hours\n\nConverting back to hours and minutes:\n8.80 hours \u2248 8 hours and 48 minutes\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests the student's ability to:\n\n* Convert between different units (minutes, seconds, hours)\n* Perform arithmetic operations (subtraction)\n* Express answers in a clear and concise format\n* Apply mathematical reasoning to solve a real-world problem\n\n"}

The results are as follows:\n\nNewspaper 1: 36.5% (January 6, sample of 500 citizens with voting rights)\nNewspaper 2: 41.0% (January 20, sample of 500 citizens with voting rights)\nNewspaper 3: 39.0% (January 20, sample of 1000 randomly selected citizens with voting rights)\nNewspaper 4: 44.5% (January 20, 1000 readers phoning in to vote)\n\nAssuming the election is held on January 25, which newspaper's result is likely to be the best for predicting the level of support for the President? Provide two reasons to support your answer.\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n* Full credit (3 points): Your answer includes at least two reasons that are mathematically rigorous and based on the data provided.
