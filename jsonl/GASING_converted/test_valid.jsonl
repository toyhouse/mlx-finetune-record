The pattern of light flashes is as follows:\n\nLight flash 1: After 0 seconds\nLight flash 2: After 3 seconds\nLight flash 3: After 6 seconds\nLight flash 4: After 9 seconds\nLight flash 5: After 12 seconds\n\nThe lighthouse sends out a total of 10 light flashes in 15 minutes. How many seconds apart are the light flashes?\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n1. A full credit (Code 1) is awarded if the student correctly calculates the time interval between each pair of consecutive light flashes.\n2. No credit (Code 0) is awarded if the student provides an incorrect answer or fails to provide a clear explanation.\n3. Missing response (Code 9) is awarded if the student does not attempt to solve the problem.\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Identify the time interval between each pair of consecutive light flashes from the diagram:\n\nLight flash 2 - Light flash 1 = 3 seconds\nLight flash 3 - Light flash 2 = 3 seconds\nLight flash 4 - Light flash 3 = 3 seconds\nLight flash 5 - Light flash 4 = 3 seconds\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of time intervals between each pair of consecutive light flashes:\n\nThere are 9 pairs of consecutive light flashes (from light flash 1 to light flash 10).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average time interval between each pair of consecutive light flashes:\n\nAverage time interval = Total number of time intervals / Number of pairs\n= 9 / 2\n= 4.5 seconds\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\nThis problem tests students' ability to read information from a diagram, identify patterns, and calculate averages. Students need to analyze the given data, identify the pattern of light flashes, and calculate the average time interval between each pair of consecutive light flashes.\n\nMathematical skills being tested include:\n\n* Data analysis and interpretation\n* Pattern recognition\n* Calculation of averages\n\n**Contextual Relevance:**\n\nThis problem is relevant to the context of lighthouse operations, where understanding the timing of light flashes is crucial for navigation and safety. Students need to apply mathematical reasoning to solve this problem, which will help them develop their analytical skills in real-world contexts.\n\n"}

The staircase has a uniform depth, which means that each step is the same width. If the total depth of the staircase is 400 cm, what is the height of each of the 14 steps?\n\n[Insert diagram of staircase]\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n* Code 1: Full credit (correct answer)\n* Code 0: No credit (incorrect answer or no attempt)\n* Code 9: Missing (no answer provided)\n\n**Example Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles and ratios. Let's start by labeling the height of each step as x cm.\n\nSince there are 14 steps in total, the sum of their heights is equal to the total height of the staircase, which is 252 cm. We can set up an equation based on this:\n\n14x = 252\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 14:\n\nx = 252 \u00f7 14\nx = 18\n\nTherefore, the height of each step is 18 cm.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis problem tests the student's ability to read information from a diagram and apply mathematical reasoning to solve a real-world problem. The use of similar triangles and ratios requires students to think critically about the relationships between different parts of the staircase and to make connections between the diagram and the mathematical concepts being tested.\n\nThe problem also requires students to consider the context of the problem, including the total height and depth of the staircase, and to use this information to inform their solution. This type of problem is relevant to real-world situations, such as designing staircases for buildings or creating visual displays for presentations.\n\n**Mathematical Skills Being Tested:**\n\n* Reading and interpreting diagrams\n* Applying mathematical concepts (similar triangles, ratios) to solve problems\n* Using context to inform mathematical reasoning\n* Solving linear equations\n\nNote: The problem is designed to be solvable with basic algebraic skills, but the solution approach requires critical thinking and mathematical reasoning.\n\n"}
