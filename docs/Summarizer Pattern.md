# Summarizer Pattern

## Intent
The Summarizer Pattern distills complex, verbose information into concise, digestible summaries while preserving the essential content and meaning. It serves as the final refinement layer that transforms detailed outputs into user-friendly, consumable results.

## Also Known As
- Condenser Pattern
- Distillation Pattern
- Information Compactor
- Essence Extractor
- Conciseness Filter

## Motivation
In many systems, especially those involving AI-generated content or complex problem-solving, raw outputs can be verbose, detailed, and potentially overwhelming for end users. While this detail is often necessary for completeness and accuracy, it may impede quick understanding or decision-making.

The Summarizer Pattern addresses this challenge by:
1. Identifying and preserving the most critical information
2. Eliminating redundant or less important details
3. Restructuring information for improved clarity and flow
4. Ensuring the output remains within size constraints
5. Maintaining the educational or informative value of the original content

Consider a mathematical problem-solving system that generates detailed solution steps. While this detailed explanation is valuable for learning, users might want a condensed version that captures the key insights and approach without wading through every calculation.

The Summarizer Pattern implements this refinement stage, transforming verbose outputs into concise, focused summaries that retain the core value of the original content.

## Applicability
Use the Summarizer Pattern when:
- Your system generates detailed outputs that may overwhelm users
- You need to present information within specific length constraints
- Users benefit from both detailed and concise versions of the same information
- Content needs to be adapted for different consumption contexts
- Information density varies significantly across different outputs
- You want to highlight the most important aspects of complex outputs

## Structure
![Summarizer Pattern Structure](https://www.example.com/summarizer_pattern.png)

## Participants
- **Client**: Initiates the summarization process by providing content to be summarized
- **SummarizerAgent**: Implements the summarization logic
- **Model/LLM**: The underlying language model that performs the actual summarization
- **Workflow**: Coordinates the overall process and directs both detailed and summarized outputs to their appropriate destinations

## Collaborations
1. The **Client** (or upstream component) submits both the original question and detailed solution to the **SummarizerAgent**
2. The **SummarizerAgent** constructs a prompt that incorporates the content and summarization criteria
3. The **SummarizerAgent** passes the prompt to the **Model/LLM**
4. The **Model/LLM** processes the prompt and returns a concise summary
5. The **SummarizerAgent** possibly validates the summary against size constraints
6. The summarized content is returned to the **Workflow** for presentation alongside or in place of the detailed content

## Implementation
The Summarizer Pattern is implemented in the provided `SummarizerAgent` class. The key elements include:

### The Prompt Template
The prompt is the critical component that guides the language model in producing effective summaries:

```python
prompt = f"""
Please summarize this math solution to be less than 512 tokens while preserving the key steps and explanation.

QUESTION: {question}

DETAILED SOLUTION: {solution}

Produce a concise but complete summary that includes:
1. The main approach used
2. Key steps in the solution
3. The final answer
4. Any important insights

Keep the summary clear and educational while being brief.
"""
```

This prompt includes:
1. Clear task instructions with a specific token constraint
2. The original question for context
3. The detailed solution to be summarized
4. An explicit structure for the summary's content
5. Criteria for balancing brevity with educational value

### Required Properties for Implementation
To implement the Summarizer Pattern effectively, the following properties are necessary:

1. **Content Prioritization Framework**: The implementation must guide the model in identifying which information is essential and which can be condensed or omitted.

2. **Size Constraints**: Clear guidelines on the desired length or size of the summary ensure the output meets practical requirements.

3. **Context Preservation**: The original question must be included to ensure the summary remains contextually relevant.

4. **Structured Output Guidelines**: Specific components that should be included in the summary must be explicitly defined.

5. **Quality Balancing**: Instructions must balance competing concerns like brevity, completeness, and educational value.

6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: For cases where summarization fails or times out, a default summary strategy should be available.

7. **Token Estimation**: Some form of output size estimation helps verify the summary meets size constraints.

## Sample Code
```python
def process(self, question: str, solution: str) -> str:
    """
    Summarize the solution to be less than 512 tokens.
    
    Args:
        question: The original question
        solution: The detailed solution
        
    Returns:
        A concise summary of the solution
    """
    console.print(f"[bold]Step 4:[/bold] Summarizing solution with {self.model_name}...")
    
    prompt = f"""
    Please summarize this math solution to be less than 512 tokens while preserving the key steps and explanation.
    
    QUESTION: {question}
    
    DETAILED SOLUTION: {solution}
    
    Produce a concise but complete summary that includes:
    1. The main approach used
    2. Key steps in the solution
    3. The final answer
    4. Any important insights
    
    Keep the summary clear and educational while being brief.
    """
    
    response, timed_out = self.invoke_with_timeout(prompt)
    
    if timed_out:
        console.print(f"[bold red]Summarization timed out[/bold red]")
        fallback_response = f"""
        Due to a timeout, here's a brief summary:

        """
        return fallback_response.strip()
    
    # Estimate token count (rough approximation: ~4 chars per token)
    estimated_tokens = len(response) / 4
    console.print(f"[green]âœ“ Summary generated with {self.model_name} (~{int(estimated_tokens)} tokens)[/green]")
    
    return response
```

## Known Uses
- Executive summaries in business reports and documentation
- Abstract generation for academic papers
- Snippet generation for search engine results
- Content preview systems in content management
- Notification systems that need to convey information concisely
- Educational platforms that offer both detailed and summary views
- Meeting notes or transcript summarization

## Related Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface (summary) to a complex subsystem (detailed content)
- **Adapter Pattern**: Transforms content from one format (verbose) to another (concise)
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds additional functionality (summarization) to an existing object
- **Filter Pattern**: Filters out non-essential information from the content
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different summarization strategies could be employed based on content type

## Consequences
### Benefits
1. Improves user experience by providing concise, digestible information
2. Allows both detailed and summary views of the same content
3. Makes complex information more accessible
4. Supports different consumption contexts (quick reference vs. in-depth study)
5. Reduces cognitive load on users
6. Optimizes for limited display or attention constraints

### Liabilities
1. May oversimplify complex concepts if not carefully implemented
2. Risk of omitting critical information
3. Quality highly dependent on the underlying model's summarization capabilities
4. Adds computational overhead to the process
5. May still exceed token limits if original content is extremely verbose
6. Challenging to verify the summary's completeness and accuracy automatically
