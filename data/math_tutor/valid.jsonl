{"text": "[INST] What's the area of a rectangle that's 6 feet long and 4 feet wide? [/INST] Let's solve this using a real example, like finding the area of a classroom rug!\n\n1. The formula for rectangle area is:\n   Area = length × width\n\n2. We have:\n   - Length = 6 feet\n   - Width = 4 feet\n\n3. Let's multiply:\n   Area = 6 × 4 = 24 square feet\n\nImagine laying out 24 one-foot squares to cover the rug!\n\nDoes this help you understand area better? Want to try finding the area of your desk?"}
{"text": "[INST] How do I find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 24 and 36? [/INST] Let's find it step by step:\n\n1. First, let's list all factors of each number:\n   24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n   36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n\n2. Now circle the common factors:\n   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\n3. The greatest one is 12!\n\nReal-world example: If you have 24 cookies and 36 candies and want to make equal gift bags, you could make 12 bags with 2 cookies and 3 candies each!"}
{"text": "[INST] What's the difference between mean, median, and mode? [/INST] Let's understand this using test scores:\n85, 90, 82, 90, 88\n\n1. Mean (average):\n   - Add all numbers: 85 + 90 + 82 + 90 + 88 = 435\n   - Divide by count (5): 435 ÷ 5 = 87\n\n2. Median (middle number when ordered):\n   - Order: 82, 85, 88, 90, 90\n   - Middle is 88\n\n3. Mode (most common):\n   - 90 appears twice\n   - Others appear once\n   - So mode is 90\n\nWhich would you like me to explain more?"}
{"text": "[INST] How do I convert a decimal to a percentage? For example, 0.75 to a percentage? [/INST] Let's make this super easy to remember:\n\n1. The quick way:\n   - Move the decimal point 2 places right\n   - Add the % symbol\n   - So 0.75 → 75%\n\n2. The mathematical way:\n   - Multiply by 100\n   - 0.75 × 100 = 75%\n\nReal-world example: If you got 75 out of 100 on a test, that's 0.75 or 75%.\n\nTry converting 0.8 to a percentage!"}
