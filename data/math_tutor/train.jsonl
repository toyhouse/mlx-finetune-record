{"text": "[INST] I need help solving this algebra problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Can you help me understand how to solve it? [/INST] Let's solve this step by step using simple numbers:\n\n1. The equation is: 2x + 5 = 13\n2. First, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\n   2x = 8\n3. Now divide both sides by 2:\n   2x ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2\n   x = 4\n\nTo check: Put 4 back in the original equation:\n2(4) + 5 = 13\n8 + 5 = 13 ✓\n\nDo you understand each step? Which part would you like me to explain more?"}
{"text": "[INST] How do I add fractions? Like 1/4 + 2/3? [/INST] Let me show you how to add fractions using a pizza example!\n\n1. First, we need the same size pieces (common denominator)\n   - 1/4 means cutting the pizza into 4 pieces\n   - 2/3 means cutting into 3 pieces\n   - We need to cut into 12 pieces (4 × 3 = 12)\n\n2. Convert each fraction:\n   - 1/4 = 3/12 (multiply top and bottom by 3)\n   - 2/3 = 8/12 (multiply top and bottom by 4)\n\n3. Now add: 3/12 + 8/12 = 11/12\n\nDoes this make sense? Would you like to try another example?"}
{"text": "[INST] What's the perimeter of a rectangle with length 8 meters and width 5 meters? [/INST] Let's solve this step by step!\n\n1. The formula for perimeter is:\n   Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)\n\n2. We have:\n   - Length = 8 meters\n   - Width = 5 meters\n\n3. Let's solve:\n   - First add: 8 + 5 = 13\n   - Then multiply by 2: 2 × 13 = 26\n\nSo the perimeter is 26 meters!\n\nThink of it like walking around the edge of the rectangle - you go along each side once."}
{"text": "[INST] Can you help me understand percentages? What is 15% of 80? [/INST] Let's break this down into easy steps:\n\n1. First, convert 15% to a decimal:\n   15% = 15/100 = 0.15\n\n2. Then multiply by 80:\n   0.15 × 80 = 12\n\nSo 15% of 80 is 12!\n\nHere's a real-world example: If a shirt costs $80 and is on 15% discount, you would save $12.\n\nWould you like to try another percentage problem?"}
{"text": "[INST] What's the volume of a cube with sides of 3 inches? [/INST] Let's visualize this with a fun example, like a Rubik's cube!\n\n1. The formula for cube volume is:\n   Volume = side × side × side (or side³)\n\n2. Our cube has:\n   - Each side = 3 inches\n\n3. Let's calculate:\n   3 × 3 × 3 = 27\n\nSo the volume is 27 cubic inches!\n\nImagine filling this cube with 27 smaller 1-inch cubes. Cool, right?"}
