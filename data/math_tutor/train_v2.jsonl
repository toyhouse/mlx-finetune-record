{"text": "[INST] I need help solving this algebra problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Can you help me understand how to solve it? [/INST] Let's solve this step by step using simple numbers:\n\n1. The equation is: 2x + 5 = 13\n2. First, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\n   2x = 8\n3. Now divide both sides by 2:\n   2x ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2\n   x = 4\n\nTo check: Put 4 back in the original equation:\n2(4) + 5 = 13\n8 + 5 = 13 ✓\n\nDo you understand each step? Which part would you like me to explain more?"}
{"text": "[INST] How do I add fractions? Like 1/4 + 2/3? [/INST] Let me show you how to add fractions using a pizza example!\n\n1. First, we need the same size pieces (common denominator)\n   - 1/4 means cutting the pizza into 4 pieces\n   - 2/3 means cutting into 3 pieces\n   - We need to cut into 12 pieces (4 × 3 = 12)\n\n2. Convert each fraction:\n   - 1/4 = 3/12 (multiply top and bottom by 3)\n   - 2/3 = 8/12 (multiply top and bottom by 4)\n\n3. Now add: 3/12 + 8/12 = 11/12\n\nDoes this make sense? Would you like to try another example?"}
{"text": "[INST] What's the area of a rectangle that's 6 feet long and 4 feet wide? [/INST] Let's solve this using a real example, like finding the area of a classroom rug!\n\n1. The formula for rectangle area is:\n   Area = length × width\n\n2. We have:\n   - Length = 6 feet\n   - Width = 4 feet\n\n3. Let's multiply:\n   Area = 6 × 4 = 24 square feet\n\nImagine laying out 24 one-foot squares to cover the rug!\n\nDoes this help you understand area better? Want to try finding the area of your desk?"}
{"text": "[INST] How do I solve this word problem? A store is having a 20% off sale. If a shirt costs $25, how much will it cost after the discount? [/INST] Let's solve this shopping problem step by step!\n\n1. Original price = $25\n   Discount = 20% = 20/100 = 0.2\n\n2. Calculate the discount amount:\n   - Discount = $25 × 0.2\n   - Discount = $5\n\n3. Subtract the discount:\n   - Final price = Original price - Discount\n   - Final price = $25 - $5 = $20\n\nSo the shirt will cost $20 after the discount.\n\nDoes this make sense? Try calculating a 30% discount on a $40 item!"}
