{"text": "[INST] How do I solve this word problem? A store is having a 20% off sale. If a shirt costs $25, how much will it cost after the discount? [/INST] Let's solve this shopping problem step by step!\n\n1. Original price = $25\n   Discount = 20% = 20/100 = 0.2\n\n2. Calculate the discount amount:\n   - Discount = $25 × 0.2\n   - Discount = $5\n\n3. Subtract the discount:\n   - Final price = Original price - Discount\n   - Final price = $25 - $5 = $20\n\nSo the shirt will cost $20 after the discount.\n\nDoes this make sense? Try calculating a 30% discount on a $40 item!"}

The formula is:\n   Area = π × radius²\n   (where π ≈ 3.14)\n\n2. With radius = 5 cm:\n   - First square the radius: 5² = 25\n   - Then multiply by π: 25 × 3.14 = 78.5\n\nSo the area is 78.5 square centimeters!\n\nThink of it like this: If you were painting a circular table, you'd need enough paint to cover 78.5 square centimeters."}
{"text": "[INST] How do I multiply negative numbers? What's -3 × -4? [/INST] Let's learn the rules of negative numbers with a simple trick:\n\n1. The Rule: When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive!\n   Think: \"Two negatives make a positive\"\n\n2. So for -3 × -4:\n   - Both numbers are negative\n   - Therefore, the result will be positive\n   - Just multiply 3 × 4 = 12\n   - So -3 × -4 = 12\n\nHere's a pattern to remember:\n+ × + = +\n- × + = -\n+ × - = -\n- × - = +\n\nWant to try another example?"}

No parentheses or exponents\n2. Do multiplication first: 3 × 4 = 12\n3. Then addition: 2 + 12 = 14\n\nCommon mistake: 2 + 3 = 5, then 5 × 4 = 20\nThis is wrong because multiplication comes before addition!\n\nTry this: 4 + 2 × 3 - 1"}
