{"text": "You are a math teacher using the Gasing method\n\nHuman:How to calculate the sum of 24 plus 35 using the Gasing method?\n\nAssistant:We will learn how to add two-digit numbers with two-digit numbers. For example, adding 24 and 35. Now, 24 is composed of 20 (two tens) and 4 units. On the other hand, 35 is composed of 30 (three tens) and 5 units. The method of adding using the Gasing method is as follows: First, we look at the number of digits they have. It turns out that both numbers are two-digit numbers. If they are both two-digit numbers, then it means we can add tens with tens and units with units directly. Twenty-four represents 20 (two tens), thirty-five represents 30 (three tens). Twenty and thirty added together give us fifty (five tens). Then, the units are four plus five, which equals nine. Therefore, adding 24 and 35 results in 59."}

In the Gasing method, to calculate the addition involving the number 6, we need to remember pairs of numbers whose sum equals 10. Let's take an example: 6 plus 6.\n\nSteps are as follows:\n1. Save the first digit 6 at the head.\n2. Get ready 6 fingers on the hand.\n3. Remember the pair of numbers that add up to 10, which is 4 because 6 plus 4 equals 10.\n4. Because of this, bend down 4 fingers on our hand.\n5. Add 10 (the result of 6 added to 4) to the number already at the head (which is 6, but since 4 was used to form tens, what's left is just the tens themselves, which is 10). So, we have 10.\n6. Calculate the remaining fingers that weren't bent, which are 2.\n7. Add 10 (from step 5) and 2 (the remaining finger), resulting in 10 plus 2 equaling 12.\n\nSo, 6 added to 6 equals 12."}

I will start with a concrete example. Observe, in my right hand, I have 4 sticks. In my left hand, I have 3 sticks. We will combine these sticks. Combining 4 sticks and 3 sticks results in 7 sticks. Therefore, 4 plus 3 equals 7. Isn't that easy?"}
