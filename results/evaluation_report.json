      "response": "Certainly! To add the fractions \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), we need to find a common denominator. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Find the least common denominator (LCD)**:\n   - The denominators are 4 and 5.\n   - The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...\n   - The multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...\n   - The smallest number that appears in both lists is 20. Therefore, the least common denominator is 20.\n\n2. **Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator**:\n   - For \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{15}{20}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 4}{5 \\times 4} = \\frac{8}{20}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the two fractions**:\n   Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{20} + \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{15 + 8}{20} = \\frac{23}{20}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify if possible**:\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{23}{20} \\) is already in its simplest form because 23 and 20 have no common factors other than 1.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{23}{20}\n\\] \n\nIf you want to express it as a mixed number, it would be \\( 1 \\frac{3}{20} \\).

      "expected": "3 3/4 cups",
      "response": "Certainly! To determine how much flour you need for 5 batches of a recipe that calls for \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) cup of flour per batch, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the amount of flour needed for one batch**: The recipe requires \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) cup of flour.\n\n2. **Determine the number of batches**: You want to make 5 batches.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed**: Multiply the amount of flour needed for one batch by the number of batches.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flour} = \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ cup} \\right) \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - First, you can express \\( 5 \\) as a fraction: \\( 5 = \\frac{5}{1} \\).\n   - Now multiply the two fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flour} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{1}\n   \\]\n   - Multiply the numerators (3 and 5) to get \\( 15 \\), and keep the denominators (4 and 1):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flour} = \\frac{15}{4}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number**:\n   - Divide \\( 15 \\) by \\( 4 \\).
