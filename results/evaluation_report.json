Let's solve the subtraction problem \\( 5,000 - 1,456 \\) step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the numbers\nWe have:\n- Minuend (the number from which we subtract): \\( 5,000 \\)\n- Subtrahend (the number to be subtracted): \\( 1,456 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Align the numbers by place value\n```\n   5,000\n - 1,456\n```\n\n### Step 3: Subtract starting from the rightmost digit\nWe start from the units place (the last digit):\n- Units place: \\( 0 - 6 \\)\n\nSince we can't subtract 6 from 0, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place.\n\n### Step 4: Borrowing from the tens place\n- The tens place in 5,000 is 0. We need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n- The hundreds place in 5,000 is also 0, so we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place.\n\nNow, let's adjust:\n- Borrowing 1 from the thousands place (which is 5) makes it \\( 4 \\) and adds 10 to the hundreds place.\n- Now, the hundreds place becomes \\( 10 \\).\n- The tens place remains \\( 0 \\).\n\nNow we have:\n```\n   4,990\n -  1,456\n```\n\n### Step 5: Subtract again\nNow we can subtract from the rightmost digits:\n- Units place: \\( 0 - 6 \\) (borrow 1)\n- Tens place: \\( 9 - 5 = 4 \\)\n- Hundreds place: \\( 9 - 4 = 5 \\)\n- Thousands place: \\( 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n\n### Step 6: Write down the result\nPutting it all together, we have:\n```\n   4,990\n -  1,456\n-------\n   3,534\n```\n\nSo, \\( 5,000 - 1,456 = 3,534 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe result of the subtraction is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3,534}\n\\] \n\nLet me know if you have any"
