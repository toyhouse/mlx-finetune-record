iamcoder18/acemath-instruct:7b,What is 542 - 159?,383,"Certainly! Let's solve the subtraction problem \(542 - 159\) step by step.

### Step 1: Align the numbers
First, align the numbers vertically so that the digits in each place value are directly above or below each other:

```
   542
-  159
```

### Step 2: Subtract starting from the rightmost digit
We start subtracting from the rightmost digit (the ones place).

#### Ones place:
Subtract \(9\) from \(2\):
\[ 2 - 9 \]

Since \(2\) is less than \(9\), we need to borrow \(1\) from the tens place.

### Step 3: Borrowing
Borrow \(1\) from the tens place (which is \(4\)):
- The \(4\) in the tens place becomes \(3\).
- The \(2\) in the ones place becomes \(12\) (since we borrowed \(10\) and added it to \(2\)).

Now, perform the subtraction in the ones place:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \]

### Step 4: Move to the tens place
Now subtract \(5\) from \(3\) in the tens place:
\[ 3 - 5 \]

Since \(3\) is less than \(5\), we need to borrow \(1\) from the hundreds place.

### Step 5: Borrow again
Borrow \(1\) from the hundreds place (which is \(5\)):
- The \(5\) in the hundreds place becomes \(4\).
- The \(3\) in the tens place becomes \(13\) (since we borrowed \(10\) and added it to \(3\)).

Now, perform the subtraction in the tens place:
\[ 13 - 5 = 8 \]

### Step 6: Move to the hundreds place
Finally, subtract \(1\) from \(4\) in the hundreds place:
\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \]

### Step 7: Combine the results
Now, combine the results from each place value:
- Ones place: \(3\)
- Tens place: \(8\)
- Hundreds place: \(3\)

### Step 1: Set Up the Problem
We have:
\[
5,000
- 1,456
\]

### Step 2: Align the Numbers
To make it easier to subtract, we can align the numbers vertically:

```
   5,000
 - 1,456
```

### Step 3: Subtract Starting from the Rightmost Digit
We start from the rightmost digit (the units place) and move left.

#### Units Place:
\[
0 - 6 = -6 \quad (\text{we need to borrow})
\]

Since we can't subtract 6 from 0, we need to borrow from the next column (tens).

### Step 4: Borrowing
- From the tens place (which is also 0), we borrow 1. This means:
  - The hundreds place becomes \(9\) (since it was originally \(0\)).
  - The tens place becomes \(10\) (since we borrowed from the next column).

Now, we have:

```
   4,990
-    1,456
```

### Step 5: Subtract the Units Place Again
Now, we can subtract:
\[
10 - 6 = 4
\]

So now we have:
```
   4,990
-    1,456
        4
```

### Step 6: Move to the Tens Place

### Method 1: Long Multiplication

1. **Write the numbers one below the other, aligning them to the right:**
   ```
     24
   × 16
   ```

2. **Multiply each digit of the bottom number (16) by the top number (24), starting from the rightmost digit:**

   - Multiply \(6\) (from 16) by \(24\):
     \[
     6 \times 24 = 144

     ```

   - Multiply \(1\) (from 16) by \(24\):
     \[
     1 \times 24 = 24
     \]
     Since this is the tens place, shift the result one position to the left:

   - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...

   The smallest common multiple is 20. Therefore, the LCD is 20.

3. **Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator**:
   - For \( \frac{3}{4} \), we need to convert it to a fraction with a denominator of 20. We do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 5 (since \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)):
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{15}{20}

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   When multiplying a fraction by a whole number, you can multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number and keep the denominator the same:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 5 = \frac{3 \times 5}{4} = \frac{15}{4}

---------
```

### Step 1: Subtract the units place

Start with the rightmost digits, which are in the units (ones) place. You have \(2 - 9\). Since \(2\) is smaller than \(9\), you'll need to borrow from the tens place.

- Borrow \(1\) ten (which is \(10\) units) from the tens column.
- The \(4\) in the tens column becomes a \(3\).
- Add \(10\) to the \(2\) in the units place, making it \(12\).

Now subtract: \(12 - 9 = 3\). Write down \(3\) in the units place.

---------
       3
```

### Step 2: Subtract the tens place

Next, move to the tens column. Now you have \(3 - 5\). Again, \(3\) is smaller than \(5\), so we need to borrow from the hundreds place.

- Borrow \(1\) hundred (which is \(10\) tens) from the hundreds column.
- The \(5\) in the hundreds column becomes a \(4\).
- Add \(10\) to the \(3\) in the tens place, making it \(13\).

Now subtract: \(13 - 5 = 8\). Write down \(8\) in the tens place.

### Step 3: Subtract the hundreds place

Finally, move to the hundreds column. You now have \(4 - 1\).

Subtract: \(4 - 1 = 3\). Write down \(3\) in the hundreds place.

phi4,What is 24 × 16?,384,"Certainly! Let's solve \( 24 \times 16 \) using the standard multiplication method, breaking it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Write the numbers in columns

```
     24
   × 16
```

### Step 2: Multiply the bottom number's rightmost digit by each digit of the top number

- Start with the rightmost digit of 16, which is 6.
- Multiply 6 by 4 (the units digit of 24):

  \[
  6 \times 4 = 24
  \]

  Write down 4 and carry over 2.

- Now multiply 6 by 2 (the tens digit of 24) and add the carried-over 2:

  \[
  6 \times 2 = 12
  \]
  
  Adding the carry-over:
  
  \[
  12 + 2 = 14
  \]

  Write down 14. So, the result of multiplying by 6 is 144.

```
     24
   × 16
  ------
    144  (This is 24 multiplied by 6)
```

### Step 3: Multiply the bottom number's next digit by each digit of the top number

- Move to the next digit in 16, which is 1. Since it's actually 10 (tens place), we'll add a zero at the end.
  
- Multiply 1 by 4 (the units digit of 24):

  \[
  1 \times 4 = 4
  \]

  Write down 4.

- Now multiply 1 by 2 (the tens digit of 24):

  \[
  1 \times 2 = 2
  \]

  Write down 2. Since we're multiplying by the tens place, add a zero at the end to shift it:

```
     24
   × 16
  ------
    144
   +240  (This is 24 multiplied by 10)

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

You have a total of 144 stickers and you want to divide them equally among 12 children. This means you need to perform a division operation where:

- The **dividend** (the number being divided) is 144.
- The **divisor** (the number by which you are dividing) is 12.

### Step 2: Set Up the Division

The mathematical expression for this problem is:

\[ 144 \div 12 \]

This means you want to find out how many times 12 fits into 144.

### Step 3: Perform the Division

To solve \( 144 \div 12 \), follow these steps:

1. **Estimate**: Determine how many times 12 can fit into 14 (the first two digits of 144). Since 12 goes into 14 once, write 1 above the line.

2. **Multiply and Subtract**: Multiply 1 by 12 to get 12. Subtract this from 14 to get a remainder of 2.

3. **Bring Down**: Bring down the next digit of 144, which is 4, making it 24.

4. **Divide Again**: Determine how many times 12 fits into 24. It fits exactly 2 times. Write 2 above the line next to the 1.

5. **Multiply and Subtract Again**: Multiply 2 by 12 to get 24. Subtract this from 24 to get a remainder of 0.

Since there are no more digits to bring down and the remainder is 0, the division is complete.

### Step 4: Write the Answer

The result of \( 144 \div 12 \) is 12. This means each child gets 12 stickers.

### Problem:
You have a recipe that requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of flour for one batch. You want to make 5 batches. How much flour do you need in total?

### Steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - You need \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of flour per batch.
   - You are making 5 batches.

2. **Set Up the Multiplication:**
   - To find out how much flour is needed for 5 batches, multiply the amount of flour needed for one batch by the number of batches:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 5
   \]

3. **Convert Whole Number to Fraction:**
   - It's often easier to work with fractions if all numbers are in fraction form. Convert 5 to a fraction:
   \[
   5 = \frac{5}{1}
   \]
   - Now the multiplication looks like this:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{1}
   \]

4. **Multiply the Fractions:**
   - Multiply the numerators (top numbers) together and the denominators (bottom numbers) together:
   \[
   \text{Numerator: } 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator: } 4 \times 1 = 4
   \]
   - So, the product is:
   \[
   \frac{15}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert Improper Fraction to Mixed Number (if needed):**
   - \( \frac{15}{4} \) is an improper fraction because the numerator is larger than the denominator.
   - Divide 15 by 4 to convert it into a mixed number:
     - 15 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 3.
   - This means:
     \[
     \frac{15}{4} = 3 \frac{3}{4}
     \]
