MathTutor,Jimmy has 3 apples. Sarah gives him 2 more apples. How many apples does Jimmy have now?,5,"Okay, so I need to figure out how many apples Jimmy has after getting some from Sarah. Let's see... Hmm.

First, the problem says Jimmy starts with 3 apples. That part seems straightforward. So initially, Jimmy has:

Jimmy: 3 apples

Now, Sarah gives him more apples. Specifically, she gives him 2 more. I need to add these 2 apples to his current total.

So, mathematically, that would be adding 2 to the number of apples Jimmy already has. Let me write that down.

Number of apples after receiving from Sarah = Number of apples Jimmy had initially + Apples given by Sarah

Which translates to:

3 (Jimmy's apples) + 2 (apples from Sarah) = ?

I think addition is what I need here. So, adding these two numbers together should give me the total number of apples Jimmy has now.

Let me calculate that. 3 plus 2 equals... hmm, 5? Wait, no, wait a second. Let's make sure I'm doing this right.

Wait, hold on, 3 plus 2 is indeed 5. So, does that mean Jimmy has 5 apples in total?

But let me think again about the problem to ensure I haven't missed anything. It says Sarah gives him 2 more apples, so it's a simple addition of 2 to his current count.

Is there any possibility that the number might have changed after this? Like, maybe if some apples were eaten or something? But the problem doesn't mention any such details. It just states that Sarah gave him 2 more apples.

So, unless there's an error in my understanding, I think adding 2 to Jimmy's initial 3 apples is correct.

Wait a second, another way to check: if I have 3 apples and add 1 apple, I get 4, right? So, adding 2 would make it 5. That seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe visualizing with objects could help. Let me imagine Jimmy has 3 apples. If Sarah gives him one more, he'd have 4. Then another one, he'd have 5. Yeah, that makes sense too.

So, putting this all together:

1. Jimmy starts with 3 apples.
2. Sarah adds 2 apples to his collection.
3. Total apples = 3 + 2 = 5

Therefore, Jimmy now has 5 apples in total.

MathTutor,There are 8 birds on a tree. 3 birds fly away. How many birds are left on the tree?,5,"Okay, so I've got this math problem here: There are 8 birds on a tree. Then, 3 birds fly away. The question is asking how many birds are left on the tree. Hmm, let's see if I can figure this out.

First off, I need to understand what the problem is saying. It mentions a tree with some birds and then some birds flying away. So, initially, there are 8 birds on the tree. Then, 3 of them leave. The question is asking how many are left. That sounds straightforward, but maybe I should break it down step by step to make sure I get it right.

Let me think about this. When you have a certain number of items and some leave, you subtract the number that left from the original amount. So in this case, if there were 8 birds on the tree and 3 fly away, then the number of birds remaining should be 8 minus 3. That makes sense because each bird that leaves takes one away from the total.

Wait a second, is it that simple? Sometimes with math problems, especially word problems, you can trip up if you don't read carefully or make an assumption that's not stated. Let me double-check to see if I interpreted the problem correctly.

The problem says: ""There are 8 birds on a tree. 3 birds fly away. How many birds are left on the tree?"" So, yes, it starts with 8, then subtracts 3 because they fly away. So that should be straightforward.

But just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider other possibilities. Maybe there's something about the trees or birds that changes when some fly away? Like maybe if the tree branches or something happens, but no, the problem doesn't mention any such things. It seems like it's a simple subtraction problem.

Another way to think about this is using objects or pictures. Imagine you have 8 apples on a table and someone takes 3 of them. How many apples would be left? That should be 5 apples remaining. So, analogously, the number of birds would be reduced by 3 from the original 8.

I can also think about this in terms of equations. If I let B represent the number of birds on the tree, then initially, B is equal to 8. Then, when 3 birds fly away, that's equivalent to subtracting 3 from B. So, the equation would be:

B = 8

MathTutor,Lisa has 4 bags of marbles. Each bag has 3 marbles. How many marbles does Lisa have in total?,12,"Okay, so I need to figure out how many marbles Lisa has in total. Let's see... She has 4 bags, and each bag contains 3 marbles. Hmm, that sounds like multiplication because there are multiple groups of the same number.

Wait, let me think about it differently. If each bag has 3 marbles, then one bag is 3 marbles. So if I have two bags, that would be 3 plus another 3, which is 6 marbles total. Then three bags would be adding another 3 to the previous total of 6, making it 9 marbles. And four bags would mean adding 3 more marbles again, so 12 marbles in total.

But wait, maybe there's a quicker way instead of adding each time. Since multiplication is repeated addition, and here we're dealing with equal groups, I can multiply the number of bags by the number of marbles per bag. So that would be 4 times 3.

Let me write it down:

Number of bags = 4

Marbles per bag = 3

Total marbles = Number of bags × Marbles per bag

So,

Total marbles = 4 × 3

What's 4 multiplied by 3? Let me count on my fingers. 1, 2, 3, 4 (for each marble in the first bag), then another set: 5, 6, 7, 8 for the second bag, and so on until I reach four bags. Wait, that might take too long.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding 3 marbles four times:

3 + 3 = 6

Then 6 + 3 = 9

And finally, 9 + 3 = 12

So after multiplying, the total is 12 marbles. That seems consistent with what I got when I added each bag step by step.

Wait another thought: If each bag has 3 marbles and there are 4 bags, then it's like having four groups of three marbles each. So to find the total, you add all those groups together:

Group 1: 3 marbles

Group 2: 3 marbles (total so far: 6)

MathTutor,Mom made 12 cookies. She shared them equally among 3 friends. How many cookies did each friend get?,4,"Of course! Let's try to figure out how many cookies each of your friends got. So, Mom made a total of 12 cookies and she wants to share them equally between her three friends. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to understand what ""equally among"" means. That should mean that each friend gets the same number of cookies, right? So, we can't have some friends getting more cookies than others because it's equal distribution.

Now, there are 12 cookies in total and 3 friends. So, if we divide the total number of cookies by the number of friends, that should give us how many each friend gets. Let me write this down:

Number of cookies per friend = Total number of cookies ÷ Number of friends

Plugging in the numbers:

Number of cookies per friend = 12 ÷ 3

Let me do this division. 12 divided by 3 is... well, 3 times 4 is 12, so that should be 4.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mess up. If each friend gets 4 cookies and there are 3 friends, then 4 times 3 equals 12, which matches the total number of cookies Mom made. So, yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think about it in groups. If I have 12 cookies and I split them into three equal groups, each group will have 4 cookies. That's another way to visualize it and confirm the answer is correct.

So, putting it all together, each friend gets 4 cookies because dividing 12 by 3 gives us 4.

I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's any other angle I should consider. Maybe considering fractions? But in this case, since we're dealing with whole cookies and equal sharing, the division is straightforward without needing to use fractions beyond the result itself.

So, yeah, each friend gets 4 cookies. That seems right!

**Final Answer**
Each friend got \boxed{4} cookies.
</think>

Mom made a total of 12 cookies and shared them equally among 3 friends. To find out how many cookies each friend received, we can use division:

\text{Number of cookies per friend} = \frac{\text{Total number of cookies}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{12}{3}

MathTutor,What is half of 8?,4,"Okay, so I have this problem: What is half of 8? Hmm, let's see. I think ""half"" means dividing something into two equal parts. So if I take the number 8 and divide it by 2, that should give me half of it.

Wait, but how do I actually perform this division step by step? Let me recall. When you have a number and you want to find half of it, you're essentially finding one out of two equal parts. So for example, if there are 8 cookies and someone asks me how many cookies they get if I split them equally between two people, I would divide 8 by 2.

So applying that logic here: If I have 8 apples and I want to share half with my friend, each of us would get... well, let's see. Half of 8 is 4, right? Because 2 times 4 is 8. So that makes sense.

But maybe I should break it down even more step by step without relying on memory. Let me try using multiplication to find half because sometimes it helps visualize the concept better. If I can figure out what number multiplied by 2 gives me 8, then that would be half of 8.

So let's set up an equation: x * 2 = 8. To solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 2. That would give me x = 8 / 2. And as I thought earlier, 8 divided by 2 is 4. So that confirms it again.

Another way to think about division is repeated subtraction. If I have 8 and I want to subtract equal parts until I reach zero, how many times can I subtract the same number? Let's say I start with 8 and try subtracting 1 each time:

8 - 1 = 7  
7 - 1 = 6

MathTutor,Sam had $5. He bought a toy car for $2 and a candy for $1. How much money does Sam have left?,$2,"Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Sam has left after he buys the toy car and the candy. Let's see... 

First, I know that Sam starts with $5. That seems straightforward because the problem says he had $5 initially. So, his total amount before any purchases is $5.

Now, he bought two things: a toy car for $2 and a candy for $1. Hmm, so I need to subtract both of these amounts from his initial $5 to find out how much he has left.

Let me write this down step by step:

1. Sam starts with $5.
2. He buys the toy car for $2. So, we subtract $2 from $5.
3. After buying the toy car, he then buys a candy for $1. We need to subtract another $1 from whatever amount he has left after the first purchase.

Let me calculate each step:

After buying the toy car:
$5 - $2 = $3

So now, Sam has $3 left after purchasing the toy car.

Next, he buys the candy:
He had $3 and spends $1 on a candy. So, subtracting $1 from $3 gives us:

$3 - $1 = $2

Therefore, after buying both the toy car and the candy, Sam is left with $2.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with money, it's easy to miscount or subtract incorrectly.

Starting again:

Sam has $5 initially.
He spends $2 on the toy car: 5 - 2 = 3
Then he spends another $1 on the candy: 3 - 1 = 2

Yep, that seems correct. So, after both purchases, Sam has $2 remaining.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding up all the money he spent and subtracting that total from his initial amount. Let's try this method too:

Total amount spent:
$2 (toy car) + $1 (candy) = $3

So, total spent is $3. 

Subtracting that from his original $5 gives us: 5 - 3 = 2.

Same result! That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.

MathTutor,What is 347 + 286?,633,"Of course! Let's break down the addition of 347 and 286 step by step. I'll explain each part so you can understand how it all adds up.

First, let's write the numbers one on top of the other to make it easier to add column by column from right to left. This is called the standard algorithm for addition:

```
  347
+ 286
------
```

Now, we'll start adding from the rightmost digit, which are the ones place.

**Step 1: Adding the Ones Place**

The first digits we add are the ones place of both numbers. In this case, that's 7 (from 347) and 6 (from 286).

7 + 6 = 13

Hmm, okay, so we have a sum of 13 in the ones place. But since we're dealing with single digits, we can't just write down 13 as our answer for this column. Instead, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column (tens place). So, let's note that.

**Carry Over:**
We have 13 in total here, so we'll write down 3 and carry over 1 to the tens place.

```
  347
+ 286

And now, our carried-over 1 is added to the next column (tens place).

**Step 2: Adding the Tens Place**

Next, we move to the tens place. The digits here are 4 (from 347) and 8 (from 286). Additionally, we have the carried-over 1 from the ones place.

So, adding these together:

4 + 8 = 12

But wait, don't forget the carried-over 1!

12 + 1 = 13

Again, this sum is more than a single digit. So, just like before, we'll write down the ones place and carry over the tens.

We have 13 in total here, so we'll write down 3 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

MathTutor,What is 542 - 159?,383,"Okay, so I have to subtract 159 from 542. Hmm, let's see how to do that properly.

First off, subtraction can sometimes be tricky, especially if the numbers are larger like 542 and 159. But wait, maybe breaking it down into smaller parts will make it easier. Let me think about this step by step.

I remember something called borrowing or regrouping in subtraction. Maybe I should try that method. Let's see:

Starting with the units place: 2 minus 9. Hmm, 2 is less than 9, so I can't subtract directly here. I need to borrow from the tens place. But wait, the tens digit is also 4. So if I borrow 1 from the tens place, it becomes 3, and then the units place gets an extra 10.

So now, in the units place: 2 + 10 = 12. Then, subtracting 9 gives me 3. Okay, that worked out. Now moving on to the tens place: originally, it was 4, but I borrowed 1 earlier, so it's now 3. So 3 minus 5? Wait, again, 3 is less than 5. Hmm, same issue.

I need to borrow from the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 5, so borrowing 1 makes it 4, and then add 10 to the tens place. So now, in the tens place: 3 + 10 = 13. Subtracting 5 gives me 8. Got that down.

Now moving on to the hundreds place: originally 5, but I borrowed 1 earlier, so it's now 4. Then subtracting 1 (from the number being subtracted) gives me 3. So putting it all together, the result is 383.

Wait a second, let me check that again because I sometimes make mistakes when borrowing. Let me write down each step more clearly:

542

Starting from the rightmost digit (units place):
2 - 9: Can't do that, so borrow from tens.
Tens digit is 4, becomes 3, and units become 12.

MathTutor,"If one box holds 12 crayons, how many crayons will be in 7 boxes?",84,"Of course! Let's try to figure out the solution step by step. 

First, I know that each box can hold 12 crayons. So if we have multiple boxes, the total number of crayons would depend on how many boxes there are. In this case, we're looking at 7 boxes.

To find the total number of crayons, I need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons each box can hold. That makes sense because if one box has 12, two boxes would have 24, and so on. 

So let me write that down:

Total crayons = Number of boxes × Crayons per box

Plugging in the numbers I have:

Total crayons = 7 × 12

Hmm, okay, what's 7 multiplied by 12? Let me calculate this step by step.

I can break it down into smaller parts to make it easier. For example, multiplying 7 by 10 is straightforward because 7 times 10 is 70. Then, I need to account for the remaining 2 in 12. So, 7 multiplied by 2 is 14.

Now, adding those two results together: 70 + 14 equals 84.

Wait a second, let me double-check that because sometimes when multiplying larger numbers, it's easy to make an error. Let me try another method just to be sure.

Another way to multiply 7 by 12 is to use the distributive property. I can think of 12 as (10 + 2), so:

7 × 12 = 7 × (10 + 2) = (7 × 10) + (7 × 2) = 70 + 14 = 84

Yep, that's the same result. So it seems like 84 is the correct total number of crayons.

Alternatively, I can visualize this as groups. If each box has 12 crayons and there are 7 boxes, then:

- The first box has 12.
- The second box adds another 12, making it 24.
- The third box brings it to 36.
- The fourth box makes it 48.
- The fifth box increases the count to 60.
- The sixth box gives us 72 crayons.
- Finally, adding the seventh box's 12 cray",True,3,multiplication
MathTutor,A class of 24 students is divided into 6 equal groups. How many students are in each group?,4,"Okay, so I have a problem here: there's a class of 24 students, and they're being divided into 6 equal groups. The question is asking how many students will be in each group. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, when something is divided into equal groups, it seems like division might come into play here. So maybe I need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups? Let me write that down as a thought process.

Total number of students: 24
Number of groups: 6

So if I want to find out how many are in each group, it's like distributing 24 items equally among 6 people or something. That sounds right. So the mathematical operation here would be division because we're splitting a quantity into equal parts.

Wait, let me make sure that makes sense. If I have 24 cookies and I want to give them out equally to 6 friends, how many does each friend get? It's 24 divided by 6, which is 4. Yeah, that works because if you multiply 6 times 4, you get back to 24.

So applying the same logic here, dividing the total number of students (24) by the number of groups (6) should give me how many are in each group. Let's do the math: 24 divided by 6 equals... hmm, 4? Wait, let me calculate that again to be sure.

Yes, 6 times 4 is 24 because 6 plus 6 is 12, and then another 6 makes 18, and another 6 brings it up to 24. So yeah, 4 times 6 is 24, which means that dividing 24 by 6 gives me 4.

So each group would have 4 students. That seems straightforward, but let me visualize this in my mind or maybe on paper to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Imagine the class as a big circle with 24 dots representing each student. Now, if I divide that circle into 6 equal parts, each part should have the same number of dots. If I count them out one by one, how many would be in each section? Let's see: starting from the top, first dot is group 1, then two more make group 2, three for group 3, four for group 4, five for group",True,3,division
MathTutor,What is 2/3 of 9?,6,"Okay, so I have this math problem: What is 2/3 of 9? Hmm, let's see. I remember that ""of"" usually means multiplication, right? So maybe I can rewrite it as a multiplication problem.

Wait, let me think again. If I'm asked for 2/3 of something, does that mean I multiply the fraction by the number? Yeah, that sounds familiar from earlier. So, if it's 2/3 of 9, then it should be (2/3) multiplied by 9.

Let me write that down to visualize better:

(2/3) × 9

Okay, so now I need to multiply a fraction by a whole number. How does that work? I think you can multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same. So, in this case, it would be (2 × 9) / 3.

Calculating the numerator first: 2 times 9 is 18. Then, divide that by 3. Hmm, 18 divided by 3 is... 6? Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3 goes into 18 six times because 3 times 6 is 18. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way without multiplying first. Like, if I divide 9 by 3 and then multiply by 2? Let me try that:

First, divide 9 by 3: 9 ÷ 3 = 3. Then, multiply the result by 2: 3 × 2 = 6. So again, I get 6.

Wait, both methods give me the same answer. That makes sense because multiplication is commutative and associative, right? So whether I multiply first or divide first, it should still work out as long as I'm consistent with the order of operations.

Let me try a different approach just to be thorough. Maybe using decimals? If 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, then multiplying that by 9 would give me:

0.6667 × 9 ≈ 6.0003

Which also rounds up to 6. So even when I convert the fraction to a decimal and do the multiplication, I still get 6.

Hmm, so all methods are pointing towards the same answer: 6. That gives me confidence that it's correct",True,4,fractions
MathTutor,Emma is saving money for a bike that costs $120. She has saved $75 so far. How much more money does she need to save?,$45,"Okay, so Emma wants to buy a bike that costs $120. She's already saved some money and now we need to figure out how much more she needs to save to reach the total cost of the bike.

First, let me understand what's given here. The total cost of the bike is $120. That's straightforward. Emma has already saved $75. So, I guess we're looking at subtracting her savings from the total cost to find out how much more she needs.

Let me write that down as a formula:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved

Plugging in the numbers:

Amount needed = $120 - $75

Hmm, let's compute this. 120 minus 75... Hmm, okay, subtracting 70 from 120 would be 50, and then subtracting another 5 gives us 45. So, is it $45?

Wait, hold on, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, we can think of this as money in terms of dollars and cents. Let me break down the numbers to make sure there's no confusion.

Total cost: $120
Amount saved: $75

So, if we subtract 75 from 120:

120 - 75 = ?

Starting from 75, how much do we need to add to reach 120? Let me count:
75 + 25 = 100
100 + 20 = 120

So that's a total of 45. That matches my initial calculation.

Alternatively, I can use another method, like breaking down the numbers into tens and ones:

Total cost: $120 is 1 ten (which is $10) and 2 hundreds ($20). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider just the dollar amounts without breaking them down into tens and hundreds since they are both single digits in terms of dollars.

But maybe if I add up step by step:

Start with $120.

Subtract $75 from that.

First subtract 70: 120 - 70 = 50

Then subtract the remaining 5: 50 - 5 = 45

Yep, same result. So, it seems consistent.

MathTutor,"What is 1,245 + 3,867?","5,112","Okay, so I have to add these two numbers: 1,245 and 3,867. Hmm, let's see how I can do that step by step.

First off, I remember when adding numbers together, it's important to line them up properly so that the digits are in the right places—like ones, tens, hundreds, thousands. That way, we don't mix up the place values and end up adding wrong.

So let me write them down one above the other:

```
 1,245
+3,867
-------
```

Now, I'll make sure each number has four digits by adding a leading zero if necessary. Wait, no—actually, both numbers already have four digits: 1,245 is five digits? No, wait, 1,245 is one thousand two hundred forty-five, which is actually four digits because the comma separates thousands from hundreds and tens.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused with commas. Let me clarify:

In some countries, numbers are separated by a comma every three digits starting from the right. So 1,245 would be one thousand two hundred forty-five, which is four digits: 1 (thousands), 2 (hundreds), 4 (tens), and 5 (ones).

Similarly, 3,867 is three thousand eight hundred sixty-seven—so that's also four digits: 3 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 6 (tens), and 7 (ones). So both numbers are correctly written with commas for thousands.

But in the way I wrote them above, they're each on their own line. Hmm, maybe it would help if I write each number as:

```
 1,245
+3,867
-------
```

So that's correct—each has four digits.

Now, to add them step by step, starting from the rightmost digit (the ones place), moving leftwards. Let me recall how addition works with columns: units, tens, hundreds, thousands.

Starting with the ones place:

5 + 7 = ?

Hmm, 5 plus 7 is 12. Wait, that's a two-digit number. So I should write down the 2 in the ones place and carry over the 1 to the next column (tens place).

So now, moving to the tens place:

4 + 6 = 1",False,5,addition
MathTutor,"What is 5,000 - 1,456?","3,544","Of course! I'll try to figure out how to subtract 1,456 from 5,000 step by step. Let's see... 

First, I should write down both numbers aligned by their place values to make it easier. So, the larger number is 5,000 and the smaller one is 1,456. It might look like this:

```
  5,000
- 1,456
```

Okay, now I need to subtract starting from the rightmost digit, which are the ones place. Let's see what that looks like.

Starting with the ones place: We have 0 (from 5,000) minus 6 (from 1,456). Hmm, can't do that because 0 is smaller than 6. So I need to borrow from the next higher place value. 

The tens place in 5,000 is a 0 as well, so borrowing there would also cause me to have to go further up. Let's see... The hundreds place is also 0, so moving up to the thousands place. There we have a 5. So I can borrow from that.

If I borrow 1 from the thousands place (which is 5), it becomes 4, and the hundreds place becomes 10. But since I need to give 10 to the tens place, which is also 0, I'll have to go up again. The hundreds place now has 10 because of the borrow from the thousands place.

But wait, no—actually, when you borrow from a higher place value, each digit becomes 9 after borrowing except for the one you're giving it. So let me think about this carefully.

Starting with:

```
    5,000
  - 1,456
```

I need to subtract in the ones place: 0 - 6. Since I can't do that, borrow 1 from the tens place. But the tens place is also 0, so I have to move up to the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 0 as well, so move up to the thousands place.

So, borrowing 1 from the thousands place (which is 5), it becomes 4, and the hundreds place becomes 10. But since we borrowed 1 for the tens place, which was also 0, now the hundreds place effectively has",False,5,subtraction
MathTutor,What is 24 × 16?,384,"Of course! Let's break down the multiplication of 24 and 16 step by step. I remember that multiplying two numbers can be done by breaking them into smaller parts, which makes it easier to handle.

First, let's write down the problem:

```
    24
  × 16
```

I think a good strategy is to multiply each digit of the second number (which is 16) with each digit of the first number (which is 24), starting from the rightmost digit. Then, we'll add up all those products.

So, let's start by multiplying 24 by 6 (the units place of 16):

```
    24
  × 6
-----
   144
```

Wait, how did I get that? Let me check again. 4 times 6 is 24, and carry over the 2. Then, 2 times 6 is 12 plus the carried-over 2 makes 14. So yes, it's 144.

Now, moving to the tens place of 16, which is 1. But since this is the tens place, we need to multiply by 10. So instead of multiplying directly, I'll write a zero at the end:

```
    24
  × 10
-----
   240
```

Wait, let me make sure that's correct. Multiplying 24 by 1 in the tens place is essentially 24 times 10, which should be 240.

Now, we need to add these two results together because when you multiply a number by a two-digit number like 16, it's equivalent to multiplying by 10 and adding the result of multiplying by 6. So:

```
   144
+ 240
-----
   384

Let me add those numbers together. Starting from the right: 4 plus 0 is 4, then 1 plus 4 is 5, and finally 2 plus nothing is 2? Wait, that doesn't make sense because when adding two numbers:

Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the answer step by step.

First, I know that dividing something equally means splitting it into parts of equal size. In this case, we have 144 stickers and 12 children. So, I need to split 144 stickers into 12 equal parts. Each part will then represent how many stickers each child gets.

I think the best way to approach this is by using division because dividing a number by another gives you the quotient, which in this case tells us how many times one number fits into another. So, if I divide the total number of stickers (144) by the number of children (12), that should give me the number of stickers each child gets.

Let me write this down: 144 divided by 12 equals... Hmm, what's 144 divided by 12? Maybe I can think about how many times 12 goes into 144. Alternatively, I could break it down into smaller numbers that are easier to handle.

I remember from multiplication tables that 12 multiplied by 10 is 120, and 12 multiplied by 3 is 36. If I add those together, 120 plus 36 equals 156. Wait, but 156 is more than 144. That can't be right because we're trying to find how many times 12 fits into 144.

Maybe I should try smaller multiples of 12. Let's see: 12 times 10 is 120, which leaves us with 144 minus 120 equals 24. Then, 12 goes into 24 exactly twice. So, that would make it 10 plus 2, which is 12. But wait, that can't be right because 12 times 12 is 144? No, hold on.

MathTutor,What is 3/4 + 2/5?,23/20,"Sure, I'll try to work through it. Let's see.

First, adding fractions can be tricky if they don't have the same denominator. So maybe I should find a common denominator for 4 and 5. Hmm, what is the least common multiple of 4 and 5? Let me think: multiples of 4 are 4,8,12,16,20... and multiples of 5 are 5,10,15,20... Oh, I see, 20 is the smallest one they both share. So 20 will be our common denominator.

Now, I need to convert each fraction so that it has 20 as the denominator. Starting with 3/4: To get from 4 to 20, we multiply by 5. So I have to do the same to the numerator. 3 times 5 is 15. So 3/4 becomes 15/20.

Next, 2/5: To change the denominator from 5 to 20, we multiply by 4. So we'll also multiply the numerator by 4. 2 times 4 is 8. So 2/5 becomes 8/20.

Now both fractions have the same denominator: 15/20 + 8/20. Since the denominators are the same, I can just add the numerators together and keep the denominator. 15 plus 8 is... let's see, 15+8=23. So that gives me 23/20.

Wait a second, 23/20 is an improper fraction. Can this be simplified? Let me check if 23 and 20 have any common factors besides 1. 23 is a prime number, right? It's only divisible by 1 and itself. 20 can be divided by 2,4,5, etc., but not 23. So the fraction cannot be simplified further.

So as an improper fraction, it's 23/20. If I wanted to convert that back to a mixed number, since 20 goes into 23 once with a remainder of 3, so that would be 1 and 3/20.

First off, the recipe uses 3/4 cup of flour each time. That means if I make one batch, I use that amount. But since I want to make 5 batches, I have to multiply the amount needed for one batch by five. Right? So it should be like 3/4 multiplied by 5.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I can visualize this with something I know, like measuring cups or something. If each cup is divided into four parts, then 3/4 would mean three of those parts. But since we're dealing with batches and flour needed per batch, it's probably better to stick with fractions.

So, the basic operation here is multiplication: (3/4) * 5. How do I do that? Well, when you multiply a fraction by a whole number, you can think of the whole number as a fraction over 1. So, 5 becomes 5/1. Then, to multiply two fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

So, let's write it out:

(3/4) * (5/1) = (3*5)/(4*1) = 15/4

Okay, so that gives me 15/4. But I should probably convert that back to a mixed number or a decimal because the question asks for how much flour you need, and it's customary in cooking to use cups as whole numbers unless fractions are involved.

Let me think about 15 divided by 4. So, 4 goes into 15 three times with a remainder of 3. So that would be 3 and 3/4 cups. Or as an improper fraction, it's 15/4. Hmm, which one is more appropriate here?

Well, the original recipe uses fractions, so maybe I should stick with fractions too. But wait, 15/4 can also be expressed as a mixed number: 3 and 3/4 cups.

Alternatively, if I convert 15/4 to a decimal, that would be 3.75 cups because 4 goes into 15 three times with 3 left over, which is 0.75 of the next unit. So, yeah, 3",False,5,word_problems

First, we align the numbers vertically so that the digits in each place value (ones, tens, hundreds) are lined up:

```
   347
+  286
```

### Step 2: Add the ones place
Next, we add the digits in the ones place:
- The digit in the ones place of 347 is 7.
- The digit in the ones place of 286 is 6.

So, \(7 + 6 = 13\).

We write down 3 (the ones digit of 13) and carry over 1 to the tens place:

```

### Step 3: Add the tens place
Now, we add the digits in the tens place along with the carry-over:
- The digit in the tens place of 347 is 4.
- The digit in the tens place of 286 is 8.
- We also have a carry-over of 1.

### Step 2: Subtract the Ones Place
Start from the rightmost digit (the ones place). 

The ones place is:
- \(2\) (from 542)
- \(-9\) (from 159)

Since \(2\) is less than \(9\), we need to borrow from the tens place.

### Step 3: Borrow from the Tens Place
Borrow \(1\) from the tens place of \(542\). This changes:
- The tens place from \(4\) to \(3\) (since we borrowed \(1\))
- The ones place from \(2\) to \(12\) (because \(10 + 2 = 12\))

Now, the problem looks like this:

```
   53(12)

- \(12 - 9 = 3\)

Write \(3\) in the ones place.

### Step 5: Subtract the Tens Place
Now move to the tens place:
- The tens place is now \(3 - 5\).

Since \(3\) is less than \(5\), we need to borrow from the hundreds place.

### Step 6: Borrow from the Hundreds Place
Borrow \(1\) from the hundreds place of \(542\). This changes:
- The hundreds place from \(5\) to \(4\) (since we borrowed \(1\))
- The tens place from \(3\) to \(13\) (because \(10 + 3 = 13\))

Now, the problem looks like this:

```
   4(13)(12)
-  159

### Step 7: Subtract the Tens Place Again
Now subtract the tens place:
- \(13 - 5 = 8\)

### Step 1: Write down the numbers
We have:
- Minuend (the number from which we subtract): \( 5,000 \)
- Subtrahend (the number to be subtracted): \( 1,456 \)

### Step 2: Align the numbers by place value
```
   5,000
 - 1,456
```

### Step 3: Subtract starting from the rightmost digit
We start from the units place (the last digit):
- Units place: \( 0 - 6 \)

Since we can't subtract 6 from 0, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place.

### Step 4: Borrowing from the tens place
- The tens place in 5,000 is 0. We need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place.
- The hundreds place in 5,000 is also 0, so we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place.

Now, let's adjust:
- Borrowing 1 from the thousands place (which is 5) makes it \( 4 \) and adds 10 to the hundreds place.
- Now, the hundreds place becomes \( 10 \).
- The tens place remains \( 0 \).

Now we have:
```
   4,990
 -  1,456
```

### Step 5: Subtract again
Now we can subtract from the rightmost digits:
- Units place: \( 0 - 6 \) (borrow 1)
- Tens place: \( 9 - 5 = 4 \)
- Hundreds place: \( 9 - 4 = 5 \)
- Thousands place: \( 4 - 1 = 3 \)

### Step 6: Write down the result
Putting it all together, we have:
```
   4,990
 -  1,456
-------
   3,534
```

So, \( 5,000 - 1,456 = 3,534 \).

iamcoder18/acemath-instruct:7b,What is 24 × 16?,384,"Sure! Let's solve \( 24 \times 16 \) step by step.

### Step 1: Break down the numbers
We can break down \( 24 \) and \( 16 \) into smaller parts to make multiplication easier. 

- \( 24 = 20 + 4 \)
- \( 16 = 10 + 6 \)

### Step 2: Use the distributive property
Now, we can use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to multiply these two numbers.

\[
(20 + 4) \times (10 + 6)
\]

### Step 3: Multiply each part
We will multiply each part of the first number by each part of the second number:

1. \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \)
2. \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \)
3. \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \)
4. \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)

### Step 4: Add the results
Now, we add all these products together:

\[
200 + 120 + 40 + 24
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add \( 200 + 120 = 320 \)
- Next, add \( 320 + 40 = 360 \)
- Finally, add \( 360 + 24 = 384 \)
