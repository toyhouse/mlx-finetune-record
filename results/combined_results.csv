MathTutor,Jimmy has 3 apples. Sarah gives him 2 more apples. How many apples does Jimmy have now?,5,"Of course! Let's break down the problem step by step to figure out how many apples Jimmy has after receiving more from Sarah.

First, we know that Jimmy starts with a certain number of apples. The problem says he has 3 apples initially. So, let's write that down:

Jimmy: 3 apples

Next, Sarah gives him some more apples. Specifically, she gives him 2 more apples. To find out the total number of apples Jimmy has now, we need to add these 2 apples to his original amount.

So, adding the 2 apples:

3 apples (Jimmy's initial count) + 2 apples (Sarah's gift) = Total apples

Let me do the math here: 3 plus 2 equals... 5. So, Jimmy has 5 apples in total after receiving them from Sarah.

Wait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when you're just starting out with math, it's easy to mix up numbers or miscount.

Starting again: Jimmy starts with 3 apples. Sarah gives him 2 more. So adding those together: 3 + 2 = 5. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think there are any other steps involved here because the problem is pretty straightforward—only one transaction where Sarah adds to Jimmy's apples. There's no subtraction or anything else mentioned.

So, summarizing:

- Initial apples: 3
- Apples received from Sarah: +2
- Total apples after addition: 5

Therefore, Jimmy has 5 apples now.

I think that covers all the necessary steps and makes sense logically. It's always good to go through each part again just to be sure, but in this case, it seems pretty clear-cut.

MathTutor,There are 8 birds on a tree. 3 birds fly away. How many birds are left on the tree?,5,"Of course! Let's tackle this problem step by step.

First, we have 8 birds sitting on a tree. That's our starting point.

Next, it says that 3 birds fly away from the tree. So, these birds leave the tree, reducing the number of birds on it.

To find out how many birds are left, we need to subtract the number of birds that flew away from the original number.

So, mathematically, that would be:

8 (original number of birds) - 3 (birds that flew away) = ?

Let's do the subtraction: 8 minus 3 equals 5.

Therefore, after 3 birds fly away, there are 5 birds remaining on the tree.

**Problem:**  
There are 8 birds on a tree. 3 birds fly away. How many birds are left on the tree?

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Number of Birds:**
   - Start with 8 birds on the tree.

2. **Birds that Fly Away:**
   - **Number of birds that fly away:** 3

3. **Calculate Remaining Birds:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining birds} = \text{Initial number of birds} - \text{Birds that fly away}

MathTutor,Lisa has 4 bags of marbles. Each bag has 3 marbles. How many marbles does Lisa have in total?,12,"Okay, so I have this problem here: Lisa has 4 bags of marbles. Each bag contains 3 marbles. The question is asking how many marbles Lisa has in total.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I need to understand what the problem is saying. So, Lisa has several bags, and each bag has a certain number of marbles. My goal is to find out the total number of marbles she has altogether.

Let me start by visualizing this. If there are 4 bags and each has 3 marbles, I can imagine four separate groups, each with three marbles inside them. To find the total, I need to combine all these marbles into one big group or something like that.

Wait, so if each bag is a separate entity with its own set of marbles, then adding them together should give me the answer. That makes sense because if you have two groups and you want to know how many there are in total when combined, you just add their quantities.

Let me write this out step by step:

1. Number of bags: 4
2. Marbles per bag: 3

So, to find the total number of marbles, I need to multiply the number of bags by the number of marbles in each bag. That is, Total marbles = Number of bags × Marbles per bag.

Let me compute that:

Total marbles = 4 × 3

Hmm, what's 4 times 3? Well, 4 multiplied by 3 is equal to 12. So, does that mean Lisa has a total of 12 marbles?

Wait, let me double-check because sometimes when you multiply, it's easy to make a mistake.

So, 4 bags each with 3 marbles:

- First bag: 3 marbles
- Second bag: 3 marbles (so far, 6 marbles)
- Third bag: 3 marbles (total now is 9 marbles)
- Fourth bag: 3 marbles (adding up to 12 marbles)

Yep, that adds up. So, multiplying 4 by 3 gives me the same result as adding 3 four times.

Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of repeated addition:

3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

Which is another way to represent multiplication. So, whether I use multiplication or repeated addition, I arrive at the same total number of mar",True,2,multiplication
MathTutor,Mom made 12 cookies. She shared them equally among 3 friends. How many cookies did each friend get?,4,"Okay, so I have this problem where Mom made 12 cookies and she wants to share them equally among her 3 friends. The question is asking how many cookies each friend gets. Hmm, let's see.

First, I need to understand what ""share equally"" means in math terms. I think it refers to division because we're splitting something into equal parts. So, if there are 12 cookies and they're being shared among 3 friends, that should be a division problem.

Let me write this down:

Total number of cookies = 12

Number of friends = 3

Each friend gets = Total number divided by number of friends

So, mathematically, that would be 12 ÷ 3. Let me calculate that.

12 divided by 3 is... let's see, 3 goes into 12 four times because 3 x 4 is 12. So each friend gets 4 cookies.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mess up the division. Sometimes when you're dividing small numbers, it's easy to mix up the numbers or miscount. Let me think about this another way. If each friend got 4 cookies, then 3 friends would have a total of 3 x 4 = 12 cookies. That matches the number Mom made, so that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can visualize it. Imagine you have 12 pieces of cookie dough and you're going to split them equally among 3 friends. So each friend gets one-third of the cookie dough. One-third of 12 is 4 because 12 divided by 3 is 4. Yep, that still works.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using multiplication as a check. If I multiply the number of cookies per friend by the number of friends, it should give me back the total number of cookies. So if each friend got 4 and there are 3 friends, then 4 x 3 = 12, which is correct.

Another perspective: Maybe using repeated subtraction. If Mom has 12 cookies and she gives one cookie to each friend until all cookies are gone, how many times does that happen? Let's see:

Start with 12.

First friend gets 1: 12 - 1 = 11

Second friend gets 1: 11 - 1 = 10

Third friend gets 1: 10 - 1 =",True,2,division
MathTutor,What is half of 8?,4,"Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is half of 8? Hmm, let's see. I remember that ""half"" means dividing something into two equal parts. So if I have a number and I want to find half of it, I should divide that number by 2.

Let me try to visualize this. Imagine I have 8 apples. If someone asks me how many apples are in half, I would split the apples equally between two people. Each person would get the same amount. So, each person gets half of the apples. That makes sense.

So applying that logic here: if there are 8 units, and I want to find half of them, I need to divide 8 by 2. Let me write that down: 8 divided by 2 equals... Hmm, let's see. 2 goes into 8 four times because 2 times 4 is 8. So, the result should be 4.

Wait a second, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I can use another method to confirm my answer. Sometimes, when you're unsure about something, thinking through it in different ways helps solidify your understanding.

Another way to find half of a number is by multiplying it by one-half. So instead of dividing 8 by 2, I can multiply 8 by 1/2. Let me do that: 8 times 1/2 equals... Well, multiplying by 1/2 is the same as dividing by 2, so again, 8 divided by 2 is 4.

Okay, both methods give me the same result. That makes me more confident that half of 8 is indeed 4. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can use a different approach. Let's think about fractions and how they relate to division.

If I have a fraction like 1/2, it means one part out of two equal parts. So if I split something into two equal sections, each section is half the size of the original. Applying that here: splitting 8 into two equal halves should give me two numbers that add up to 8 and are each half of 8.

Let's see, what number plus itself equals 8? That would be... 4 because 4 plus 4 is 8. So if I split 8 into two parts, both being 4, then each part is half of the original. Therefore, half of 8 must be 4.",True,2,fractions
MathTutor,Sam had $5. He bought a toy car for $2 and a candy for $1. How much money does Sam have left?,$2,"Of course! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Sam initially has $5. That's our starting point.

Next, he buys a toy car for $2. So we need to subtract the cost of the toy car from his initial amount. Let me do that: $5 minus $2 equals $3. Now, Sam has $3 left after buying the toy car.

Then, he also buys a candy for $1. We'll subtract the price of the candy from what he had left after buying the toy car. So, $3 minus $1 gives us $2. That means Sam has $2 remaining after both purchases.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything:

- Starting amount: $5
- After buying the toy car: $5 - $2 = $3
- After buying the candy: $3 - $1 = $2

Yep, that seems right. So Sam has $2 left after his purchases.

MathTutor,What is 347 + 286?,633,"Alright, so I have to add 347 and 286. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when adding numbers, it helps to start from the rightmost digit because that's the ones place. So maybe I should begin with the ones place.

First, looking at the ones digits: 7 (from 347) and 6 (from 286). Adding those together, 7 + 6 equals... let me think, that's 13. Okay, so I can write down a 3 in the ones place of my answer and carry over the 1 to the tens place.

Next up are the tens digits: 4 (from 347) and 8 (from 286). Adding those gives me 4 + 8 = 12. But don't forget, I have that carried-over 1 from earlier. So adding 12 and 1 makes it 13 again. That means I write down another 3 in the tens place and carry over another 1 to the hundreds place.

Now moving on to the hundreds digits: 3 (from 347) and 2 (from 286). Adding those together, 3 + 2 = 5. Plus the carried-over 1 makes it 6. So I write down a 6 in the hundreds place. There are no more digits left to add beyond that.

Putting it all together, from the ones, tens, and hundreds places, we have 6 (hundreds), 3 (tens), and 3 (ones). That gives me 633 as my final answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check. Maybe I should try adding them vertically to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So writing it out:

Starting from the ones place: 7 + 6 is indeed 13. I carry over 1, write down 3.

Tens place: 4 + 8 is 12, plus the carried-over 1 makes 13. So again, write down 3 and carry over 1.

Hundreds place: 3 + 2 is 5, plus the carried-over 1 gives 6. So that's correct.

MathTutor,What is 542 - 159?,383,"Alright, so I have this subtraction problem here: 542 minus 159. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach it. I remember from school that when subtracting numbers, we usually start from the rightmost digit and move left, borrowing if needed. Let me try to recall exactly what that means.

First, let me write down the numbers vertically so I can visualize them better:

```
  542
-159
```

So, 542 is the top number, and 159 is the bottom number. Now, starting from the rightmost digit, which are the units place. The top number has a 2 in the units place, and the bottom number has a 9 there. Wait, 2 minus 9... Hmm, that can't be done without borrowing because we can't subtract a larger digit from a smaller one in the same place.

So, I think I need to borrow from the tens place. Let me see how that works. The top number is 542, so moving left, the next digit is 4 in the tens place. If I borrow 1 from there, it becomes 3, and then add 10 to the units place. So now, the units digit becomes 12 (because we borrowed 1), and the tens digit goes down from 4 to 3.

Now, subtracting the units place: 12 minus 9 is 3. Okay, that's straightforward. Next up is the tens place. The top number now has a 3 in the tens place, and the bottom number also has a 5 there. Again, 3 minus 5 can't be done without borrowing.

So, I need to borrow from the hundreds place. The top number is 542, so moving left, the hundreds digit is 5. If I borrow 1 from that, it becomes 4, and add 10 to the tens place. So now, the tens digit goes down from 3 to 13.

Subtracting the tens place: 13 minus 5 is 8. Got that down. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The top number has a 4 left there (since we borrowed earlier), and the bottom number also has a 1 in the hundreds place.

So, subtracting the hundreds place: 4 minus 1 is 3. Therefore, putting it all together, the",False,3,subtraction
MathTutor,"If one box holds 12 crayons, how many crayons will be in 7 boxes?",84,"Of course! Let's try to figure out how to solve this step by step. So the problem is: If one box holds 12 crayons, how many crayons will be in 7 boxes? 

First, I think it's a multiplication problem because we're dealing with groups of items. Each box has the same number of crayons, which makes sense to multiply. But let me break it down more slowly.

Let's start by understanding what ""one box holds 12 crayons"" means. That means if you have just one box, there are 12 crayons inside it. So each box is a container that can hold 12 items—crayons in this case.

Now, the question is asking about 7 boxes. So we need to find out how many crayons are in total when we have 7 such boxes. Since each box has the same number of crayons, it's just multiplying the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

I remember that multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. For example, if you have 3 boxes and each has 12 crayons, then adding 12 three times would give the total number of crayons: 12 + 12 + 12. That's like 3 multiplied by 12.

But maybe I can visualize this to make it clearer. Imagine you have a bunch of boxes on a table, and each one has 12 crayons inside. If you take out all the crayons from each box and put them together, how many would you have in total?

Let me count step by step:

- Box 1: 12 crayons
- Box 2: another 12 crayons (total so far: 24)
- Box 3: another 12 (total: 36)
- Box 4: 12 more (total: 48)
- Box 5: 12 again (total: 60)
- Box 6: 12 (total: 72)
- Box 7: 12 more (total: 84)

So after adding each box's crayons, the total is 84. That makes sense because I added 12 seven times.

Alternatively, using multiplication as a shortcut, instead of counting each time, you can just multiply 12 by 7. So 12 multiplied by 7 equals... let",True,3,multiplication
MathTutor,A class of 24 students is divided into 6 equal groups. How many students are in each group?,4,"Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a class of 24 students, and they're being divided into 6 equal groups. The question is asking how many students will be in each group. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, when something is divided into equal parts, that usually means we're dealing with division. So I guess I need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. That makes sense because if you have a certain amount and you split it equally among several people or groups, each group should get an equal share.

So in this case, the total number is 24 students, and we're splitting them into 6 groups. So mathematically, that would be 24 divided by 6. Let me write that down: 24 ÷ 6 = ?

Wait a second, do I remember how division works? Yeah, division is the opposite of multiplication. So if I know what number multiplied by 6 gives me 24, then that's my answer.

Let me think about the multiplication table for 6. Hmm, 6 times 1 is 6, 6 times 2 is 12, 6 times 3 is 18, and 6 times 4 is 24. Oh! So 6 multiplied by 4 equals 24. That means if I divide 24 by 6, the answer should be 4.

So each group would have 4 students. Let me just visualize this to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Imagine 24 students standing in a line. If we split them into 6 equal groups, how many would be in each? Starting from the front: first group has student 1-4, second group 5-8, third group 9-12, fourth group 13-16, fifth group 17-20, and sixth group 21-24. Wait, that's only six groups, each with four students? Hmm, no, actually wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, hold on. If we have 24 students divided into 6 equal groups, then each group should be 24 ÷ 6 = 4 students. So that's correct because if you take 4 students six times, you get 24. Let me count them again: Group 1: 1-",True,3,division
MathTutor,What is 2/3 of 9?,6,"Of course! Let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is: What is 2/3 of 9? 

First, I want to make sure I understand the question correctly. ""Of"" in math problems generally means multiplication. So when someone says ""What is X of Y?"" they're asking for X multiplied by Y. In this case, X is 2/3 and Y is 9. So essentially, we need to calculate (2/3) * 9.

Now that I've rephrased the question in my own words, let's move on to solving it. Multiplying a fraction by a whole number can sometimes be tricky for some people, but I remember there's a straightforward method to do this. 

One approach is to multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number and then keep the denominator as it is. So, applying that here: Multiply 2 (the numerator) by 9 (the whole number), which gives us 18. Then, we leave the denominator unchanged, so now our fraction becomes 18/3.

After simplifying 18 divided by 3, I can see that it equals 6. So, putting it all together: (2/3) * 9 = 18/3 = 6.

Wait a second, let me verify this another way to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another method is to convert the fraction into a decimal and then multiply by the whole number. 

The fraction 2/3 as a decimal is approximately 0.6667 (since 2 divided by 3 equals 0.6666...). Multiplying this decimal by 9: 0.6667 * 9 ≈ 6.0003, which is very close to 6. So that checks out.

Alternatively, I can think of dividing the whole number into equal parts and then taking a portion. For example, if I divide 9 into three equal parts, each part would be 3 (since 9 ÷ 3 = 3). Then, taking two of those parts would give me 2 * 3 = 6.

Just to explore another method, maybe using visual representation or models? Imagine having a pizza cut into 3 equal slices. If I have 2 out of those 3 slices, and I want to find how much that is in terms of the whole pizza, which is divided into 9",True,4,fractions

So, the problem is: Emma is saving money for a bike that costs $120. She has saved $75 so far. How much more money does she need to save?

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know the total cost of the bike is $120. That means if Emma saves all her savings towards the bike, she needs a total of 120 dollars. But right now, she only has saved some amount, which is $75. So, to find out how much more she needs, we need to subtract what she already has from the total cost.

So, mathematically, that would be:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved

Plugging in the numbers:

Amount needed = 120 - 75

Let me do this subtraction. Hmm, 120 minus 75... Let's see, starting from 75 and counting up to 120.

From 75 to 80 is 5 more, so that gets us to 80. Then, we still need 40 more because 80 plus 40 is 120. So, adding those together: 5 + 40 = 45. Therefore, 120 minus 75 equals 45.

So, that means Emma needs to save an additional $45 more to afford the bike.

Wait a second, let me double-check my subtraction just to be sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when subtracting, it's easy to miscount or drop a zero somewhere.

Another way to think about this is using place value. Let's break down both numbers into tens and ones:

120 can be thought of as 1 hundred, 2 tens, and 0 ones.
75 can be broken down into 0 hundreds, 7 tens, and 5 ones.

Subtracting the ones first: 0 minus 5. Hmm, we can't subtract 5 from 0, so we need to borrow from the tens place. So, the 2 tens become 1 ten, and the 0 ones become 10 ones. Now, subtracting the ones: 10 - 5 = 5.

I remember that when adding numbers together, it's important to line them up correctly so that the digits are in their proper places—like ones, tens, hundreds, etc. That way, you can add each column starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place.

First, maybe I should write them down one above the other, aligning their decimal points. Since both numbers don't have a decimal point, it's just about lining up the digits properly.

So, 1,245 and 3,867. Let me write that out:

```

Wait, but I think commas are used to separate thousands, so maybe it's better to write them without the commas for clarity? Like:

Starting with the ones place: 5 + 7. That should be easy.

Next, moving to the tens place: 4 + 6. But wait, we have this carried-over 1 from the previous addition. So, it's actually 4 + 6 + 1 = 11.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I got that right. The digits in the tens place are 4 and 6. Then add any carryover from the ones place. Since we had a carryover of 1, it's 4 + 6 + 1. That is 11.

So, write down 1 in the tens place and carry over another 1 to the hundreds place.

Wait, they already look similar in terms of digit count; 5,000 is a four-digit number and 1,456 is also four digits. Perfect!

Now, I'll start subtracting from the ones place moving left.

Starting with the ones place: we have 0 (from 5,000) minus 6 (from 1,456). Hmm, that can't be done because 0 is less than 6. So, I need to borrow one from the tens place. But the tens place is also 0 in this case.

Wait, maybe I should think of this in terms of place values. Let me write each number broken down into its digits:

- 5,000 = 5 * 1,000 + 0 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 0 * 1

Let me try to recall how that works exactly. So, for example, when you have two numbers like 24 and 16, you can break them down as follows:

- 24 = 20 + 4
- 16 = 10 + 6

Then, each of these parts is multiplied by the other number, and the results are added together. So, it would look like this:

(20 × 10) + (20 × 6) + (4 × 10) + (4 × 6)

Let me compute each of these components one by one.

First component: 20 × 10 = 200

Second component: 20 × 6. Hmm, that's 120 because 20 times 5 is 100 and then adding another 20 gives 120.

Third component: 4 × 10 = 40

Fourth component: 4 × 6 = 24

Now, I need to add all these results together:

200 + 120 + 40 + 24

Let me compute this step by step. Starting with 200 + 120 is 320.

Then, adding 40 to that: 320 + 40 = 360.

Finally, adding 24: 360 + 24 = 384

MathTutor,"If 144 stickers are divided equally among 12 children, how many stickers does each child get?",12,"Okay, so I have this problem here: If 144 stickers are divided equally among 12 children, how many stickers does each child get? Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the answer step by step.

First, maybe I should understand what it means to divide something equally. So if we're dividing 144 stickers among 12 kids, each kid gets an equal number of stickers. That sounds like division because we are splitting a total amount into equal parts.

So, in math terms, this is probably 144 divided by 12. Let me write that down: 144 ÷ 12 = ?

But wait, maybe I should think about it differently. If each child gets the same number of stickers, then we can find how many stickers per child by dividing the total number by the number of children.

Yeah, so 144 divided by 12 is the right approach here.

Now, let me try to do this division step by step because I sometimes get confused with larger numbers. So, 144 ÷ 12. Hmm, how does that work?

I remember from school that when dividing two numbers, you can think about how many times the divisor fits into the dividend. Here, the divisor is 12 and the dividend is 144.

So, let me try to see: How many times does 12 go into 14? Well, 12 goes into 14 once because 12 × 1 = 12, which is less than 14. But if I subtract that from 14, the remainder would be 2.

Wait, no, actually, in division, you take each digit one by one. Maybe it's better to think of this as:

Divide both numbers by a common factor first to simplify the problem. So, what is a common factor of 144 and 12?

Well, 12 is a factor of 144 because 12 × 12 = 144. Wait, no: 12 × 12 is actually 144? Let me check that.

Wait, 10 times 12 is 120, and then adding another 12 makes it 132, which is less than 144. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 144 ÷",True,5,division
MathTutor,What is 3/4 + 2/5?,23/20,"Okay, so I have to add these two fractions: 3/4 and 2/5. Hmm, adding fractions can be tricky sometimes, but I think if I follow the right steps, it should work out.

First off, let's remember what fractions are. A fraction has a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). The numerator tells me how many parts of something we have, and the denominator tells us into how many equal parts the whole is divided. So in this case, 3/4 means three parts out of four equal parts, and 2/5 means two parts out of five equal parts.

But to add them together, they need to be ""like"" fractions, right? Like having the same denominator. Because if you have different denominators, it's like trying to compare apples and oranges. So I guess the first step is to find a common denominator for 4 and 5.

Wait, how do I find a common denominator? I think it has something to do with multiples of both numbers. Let me see... The denominators are 4 and 5. What's their least common multiple (LCM)? That would be the smallest number that both 4 and 5 can divide into without leaving a remainder.

Let me list out the multiples of each:

Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.
Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.

Looking for the smallest common one... Oh, 20! So 20 is the least common multiple of 4 and 5. That means I can convert both fractions to have 20 as their denominator.

Okay, so how do I change 3/4 into a fraction with 20 as the denominator? Well, I need to find out what number multiplied by 4 gives me 20. Let's see: 4 times 5 is 20. So I have to multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 3/4 by 5.

Calculating that: 3 * 5 = 15, and 4 * 5 = 20. So, 3/4 becomes 15/20.

Cool, now let's do the same for 2/5. We need to change this fraction to have a denominator of 2",False,5,fractions
MathTutor,"A recipe calls for 3/4 cup of flour. If you want to make 5 batches, how much flour do you need?",3 3/4 cups,"Okay, so I have this recipe that requires 3/4 cup of flour, and I need to figure out how much flour is needed if I make 5 batches of the recipe. Hmm, let's break this down.

First off, each batch uses 3/4 cup of flour. So, for one batch, it's straightforward: you just take 3/4 cup. But now, since I want to make 5 batches, I need to multiply that amount by 5. That makes sense because if one batch is 3/4 cup, five batches would be 3/4 cup multiplied by 5.

Let me write this out as an equation:

Total flour needed = (Flour per batch) × (Number of batches)
So,

Total flour = (3/4 cup/batch) × 5 batches

Wait a second, the 'batches' unit cancels out because I'm multiplying by 5 batches. So it's just 3/4 multiplied by 5.

Okay, so now I need to compute 3/4 times 5. Hmm, how do you multiply fractions by whole numbers? I think you can treat the whole number as a fraction over 1. So 5 is the same as 5/1. Then, when multiplying two fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

So,

(3/4) × (5/1) = (3×5)/(4×1) = 15/4

Alright, so that gives me 15/4 cups of flour needed for five batches. But wait, 15/4 is an improper fraction. I remember from school that it's better to write this as a mixed number or a whole number with a remainder.

Let me convert 15/4 into a mixed number. To do that, divide the numerator by the denominator: 15 divided by 4. How many times does 4 go into 15? It goes in three times because 4×3 is 12, and there's a remainder of 3.

So,

15/4 = 3 and 3/4

Which means 3 whole cups plus an additional 3/4 cup. So, that's the total amount needed for five batches.

### Step 1: Align the numbers
First, align the numbers vertically so that the digits are in the same columns (hundreds, tens, and units).

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  542 \\
- 159 \\
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Subtract the units place
Subtract the digits in the units place (the rightmost column). 

\[
2 - 9 = -7
\]

Since we can't have a negative number, we need to borrow from the tens place. 

### Step 3: Borrow from the tens place
Take 1 from the tens place of 542 (which is 4), making it 3, and add 10 to the units place.

Now we have:

- Units place: \(12\) (since \(2 + 10 = 12\))
- Tens place: \(3\) (since \(4 - 1 = 3\))

Now we can subtract in the units place:

\[
12 - 9 = 3
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the tens place
Now, move to the tens place. We have:

\[
3 - 5
\]

Again, since \(3\) is less than \(5\), we need to borrow from the hundreds place.

### Step 5: Borrow from the hundreds place
Take 1 from the hundreds place of 542 (which is 5), making it 4, and add 10 to the tens place.

Now we have:

- Tens place: \(13\) (since \(3 + 10 = 13\))
- Hundreds place: \(4\)

Now we can subtract in the tens place:

\[
13 - 5 = 8
\]

### Step 6: Subtract the hundreds place
Finally, move to the hundreds place. We have:

\[
4 - 1 = 3
\]

### Step 7: Combine the results
Now we combine the results from each column:

- Hundreds place: \(3\)
- Tens place: \(8\)
- Units place: \(3\)

iamcoder18/acemath-instruct:7b,What is 3/4 + 2/5?,23/20,"Certainly! To add the fractions \( \frac{3}{4} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \), we need to find a common denominator. Here are the steps:

1. **Find the least common denominator (LCD)**:
   - The denominators are 4 and 5.
   - The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
   - The multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
   - The smallest number that appears in both lists is 20. Therefore, the least common denominator is 20.

2. **Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator**:
   - For \( \frac{3}{4} \):
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{15}{20}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{2}{5} \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{8}{20}
     \]

3. **Add the two fractions**:
   Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them:
   \[
   \frac{15}{20} + \frac{8}{20} = \frac{15 + 8}{20} = \frac{23}{20}
   \]

4. **Simplify if possible**:
   - The fraction \( \frac{23}{20} \) is already in its simplest form because 23 and 20 have no common factors other than 1.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{23}{20}
\]

iamcoder18/acemath-instruct:7b,"A recipe calls for 3/4 cup of flour. If you want to make 5 batches, how much flour do you need?",3 3/4 cups,"Certainly! To determine how much flour you need for 5 batches of a recipe that calls for \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of flour per batch, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the amount of flour needed for one batch**: The recipe requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of flour.

2. **Determine the number of batches**: You want to make 5 batches.

3. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed**: Multiply the amount of flour needed for one batch by the number of batches.
   \[
   \text{Total flour} = \left( \frac{3}{4} \text{ cup} \right) \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - First, you can express \( 5 \) as a fraction: \( 5 = \frac{5}{1} \).
   - Now multiply the two fractions:
   \[
   \text{Total flour} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{1}
   \]
   - Multiply the numerators (3 and 5) to get \( 15 \), and keep the denominators (4 and 1):
   \[
   \text{Total flour} = \frac{15}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number**:
   - Divide \( 15 \) by \( 4 \). The result is \( 3 \) with a remainder of \( 3 \).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{15}{4} = 3 \frac{3}{4} \).

So, the total amount of flour you need for 5 batches is \( 3 \frac{3}{4} \) cups. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3 \frac{3}{4} \text{ cups}}
